<p>¶ I believe in the Motherhood of
God. I believe in the blessed Trinity
of Father, Mother and Child. ¶ I
believe that God is here, and that
we are as near Him now as ever we
shall be. I do not believe He started
this world a-going and went away and
left it to run itself. I believe that we
are all sons of God, and it doth not
yet appear what we shall be. I believe
the only way we can reach the
Kingdom of Heaven is to have the
Kingdom of Heaven in our hearts.
¶ I believe in freedom—social, economic,
domestic, political, mental,
spiritual ❦ I believe in every man
minding his own business. I believe
in sunshine, fresh air, friendship,
calm sleep, beautiful thoughts. ¶ I
believe in the purifying process of
sorrow, and I believe that death is
a manifestation of life. I believe the
Universe is planned for good ❦</p>

<p>¶ I wish to be simple, honest, natural,
frank, clean in mind and clean in
body, unaffected—ready to say “I
do not know,” if so it be—to meet
all men on an absolute equality—to
face any obstacle and meet every
difficulty unafraid and unabashed ❦
I wish to live without hate, whim,
jealousy, envy or fear. I wish others
to live their lives, too—up to their
highest, fullest and best. To that end
I pray that I may never meddle, dictate,
interfere, give advice that is not
wanted, nor assist when my services
are not needed. If I can help people,
I will do it by giving them a chance
to help themselves; and if I can uplift
or inspire, let it be by example,
inference and suggestion, rather
than by injunction and dictation.

<p class="dropcap">So this, then, is an essay
on the American Philosophy.
The American Philosophy
is founded on the
Science of Economics.
¶ Just here, in order that we may speak
a common language, a few definitions
are in order. Economics is the Science
of the production, distribution and use
of wealth. Science is accurate, organized
knowledge founded on fact—or, as
Herbert Spencer expressed it, “Science
is the classified knowledge of the common
people.” All that which is simply assumed,
believed, conjectured, taken on
dogmatic statement, or mayhap read
out of printed books, is unscientific, no
matter how plausible ❦ All practical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
businessmen are scientists. ¶ Business
is a vocation. Philosophy is—or should
be—an avocation. To make a business
of philosophy is to institutionalize
and dilute it, just as to institutionalize
love and religion is to degrade and lose
them. Religion is philosophy touched
with emotion ❦ Philosophy is your
highest conception of life, its duties and
its destiny. A religious organization
is a different thing from religion. A religious
organization is built on a feeling
made static, or fear frozen stiff. It then
becomes a superstition, and is employed
as a police system, and is taxed all the
traffic will bear. ¶ Science is definite,
accurate, organized knowledge concerning
the things that make up our environment.
Modern philosophy is the
distilled essence of wisdom that eventually
flows from science. Or, if you please,
philosophy is the explanation of science—a
projection from science ❦ Transportation,
manufacturing, distribution,
advertising and salesmanship are all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
variants of business. Each and all are
scientific, that is, capable of analyzation
and demonstration. Weight, size,
color, number, qualities and time are all
elements of science. ¶ Theology is antique
and obsolete philosophy. It never
is nor ever was scientific, not being
derived from knowledge. Faith is the
first item in its formula. Theology comes
to us from dogmatic statements gotten
from books or the hearsay words of
men long dead. Theology is voodooism;
in matters of importance it is in the same
class as alchemy, astrology, palmistry,
mantology and augury ❦ Science is
understood, while theology is believed.
Psychology is the science of human
minds and their relationship one to
another ❦ Superstition is scrambled
science, or a religious omelet flavored
with fear. ¶ Organized religion being
founded on superstition is, perforce,
not scientific ❦ And all that is not
scientific—that is, truthful—must be
bolstered by force, fear and falsehood.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
Thus we always find slavery and organized
religion going hand in hand. ¶ Business,
to be successful, must be based on
science, for demand and supply are
matters of mathematics, not guesswork.
Civilization turns on organization. And
organization, in order to be of any value,
must be scientific. ¶ Economics is a new
science. History does not show a single
instance of its existence in the days
of Greece and Rome ❦ They had
simple mathematics, but not complex.
Fractions, percentages, statistics, averages,
were beyond them. The blueprint,
even for humorists, was unguessed ❦
Philosophy was speculation; business
was barter. Since then, up to within a
few years ago, the problem of how man
could save his soul has been uppermost.
This world has been neglected in the
endeavor to gain another. When the
Science of Economics is finally formulated
it will be expressed first in America ❦
In America all nations meet and
blend. Here the factors, elements and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
categories of Economics are to be found.
Here we have one language, and no
more, and this is necessary for the expression
of a new science ❦ The first
endeavor to found Economics as a
science was the work of Adam Smith.
¶ And when Thomas Henry Buckle said
that Adam Smith’s <i>Wealth of Nations</i>
had influenced the world for good more
than any other book ever written, save
none, he stated truth. ¶ Economics
changes man’s activities. As you change
a man’s activities you change his way
of living, and as you change his environment
you change his state of mind.
Precept and injunction do not perceptibly
affect men; but food, water, air,
clothing, shelter, pictures, books, music,
will and do. Adam Smith, John Stuart
Mill and Karl Marx, all wrote on Economics,
but none was an Economist.
Each based his logic largely on presumption,
assumption and hypothesis.
If this happens, then that will occur.
They were Political Economists—they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
pursued Economics as a policy, not as
truth. They loved love, not the lady.
They were students of Economics, and
their work was not grounded in Science.
Since the days of Smith, Mill and Marx
we have had many students of Economics ❦
But the world has not yet
produced an Economist. To be an
Economist, a man must be a Scientist.
He must be both a man of action, and
one who knows why he acts. He must
work and he must contemplate his work.
He must act and he must think. ¶ A
Scientist is the man who has done the
thing—who has seen and knows. Then
from his positive knowledge springs his
Philosophy. And the Philosophy of a
businessman, analyzed, explained and
formulated, would constitute a Science
of Economics. ¶ The American Philosophy
will be formulated by Scientists—by
Businessmen who have succeeded.
Thackeray’s lawyer in the Debtors’
Prison, who was working out a new
financial policy for the Nation, was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
not a Scientist ❦ His knowledge was
academic and his scheme conjectural.
Science was outside of his orbit. He
lacked experience. He had feelings, but
not facts ❦ He did not have enough
cosmic mortar to construct an arch.
Emotionalism, charity, altruism, optimism,
are not science, and they may be
hysteria. ¶ When I speak of success I
do not mean it in the sordid sense. A
successful man is one who has tried,
not cried; who has worked, not dodged;
who has shouldered responsibility, not
evaded it; who has gotten under the
burden, not merely stood off, looking
on, giving advice and philosophizing on
the situation. In fact, the result of a
man’s work is not the measure of success.
To go down with the ship in storm and
tempest is better than to paddle away to
Paradise in an Orthodox canoe. To have
worked is to have succeeded—we leave
the results to time. Life is too short to
gather the Harvest—we can only sow.
¶ Up to the year Eighteen Hundred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
Seventy-six the business world was
tainted by trickery in trade ❦ The
methods of booth and bazaar were
everywhere practised. Business was
barter, and he who could cheat and not
get caught was accounted clever. On
the customs of the time there was no
copyright. They were a take-over from
monarchical days ❦ But a new ethic
has arrived. Within ten years’ time the
thought has gone through the entire
business fabric that to cheat and not
get caught is really a worse calamity
than to get caught. To be caught means
that some one has applied the brake
and you are given pause. Not to get
caught means that you are headed for
the precipice on the high clutch and
down grade. To cheat another is to
cheat yourself. Theology did not teach
us this, for precept and preaching never
touch our lives. We shed them. We are
moved in only one way, and that is by
self-interest ❦ Cut off our food-supply
and we are no longer apathetic. And<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
self-interest is a form of selfishness;
it is the desire for life ❦ It is the
instinct of self-preservation in action.
It was all a matter of mental growth,
evolution. ¶ The discovery of truth
as our most valuable business asset
is the one great achievement of the
age in which we live ❦ For truth there
is no substitute, and this discovery
was made by businessmen. Honesty as
a working policy was first put forth by
Benjamin Franklin; and his remark
was regarded as a mere pleasantry until
yesterday. The clergy have not yet
adopted it; the doctors are considering
it, and the lawyers haven’t heard of it.
However, all these will finally adopt it,
as a last resort, as a means of self-preservation.
¶ Economics based on falsehood
leads to dissolution. Falsehood is
a polite form of conquest. The lie is exploitation.
The preacher has diverted
us while the lawyer picked our pocket;
the doctor gives you ether and accomplishes
the same result ❦ Egypt,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
Rome and Greece lived on their slaves
and outlying colonies. ¶ Slave labor is
the most expensive kind. In time the
land is exhausted, and the slaves die.
But before this happened to the capitals
that were, the aristocrats who wasted,
destroyed and consumed had gotten
nervous debility, and were impotent,
also impudent. Then they died and the
barbarian overran the land ❦ A wise
Economist—and America has many—could
have figured out exactly how
long Babylon and Nineveh would have
lasted ❦ None of these ancient civilizations
produced economists. They
had soothsayers, priests, lawyers, poets,
artists, clowns, dramatists, orators,
rhetoricians, singers, philosophers. And
most of all they had guzzlers and gormands.
But they had no scientists, and
their philosophy, being based on augury,
dreams, theology and fear, was futile
and fallacious. A philosophy that is not
founded on science is false in theory
and base in practise. ¶ Modern business<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
betters human environment. ¶ It means
gardens, flowers, fruits, vegetables; it
means quick, safe and cheap transportation
of people, commodities and
messages; it means books, maps, furniture,
pictures, playgrounds, pure water,
perfect sewerage, fresh air, sunshine,
health, happiness, hope, light and love—because
business gives opportunities
for all to work, earn, grow and become.
Business consists in the production,
transportation and distribution of the
things that are necessary to human life.
Through this exercise of our faculties
we educe the best that is in us; in other
words, we get an education. ¶ Inasmuch
as business supplies the necessities of
life, it is impossible to have a highly
evolved and noble race except where
there is a science of business. Business
is human service. Therefore, business
is essentially a divine calling. ¶ Once
men believed religion to be the chief
concern of mortals here below. Other
men have thought that killing is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
chief concern of mortals here below.
Gladstone once said, “Only two avenues
of honor are open to young men in
England—the army and the church.”
This has been the prevailing opinion of
the world for nearly two thousand
years, and is the one reason why the
Dark Ages were dark. During those
years of night the fighting man was
supreme. It was a long panic, and human
evolution was blocked through fear ❦
The race crawled, crept, hid, dodged,
secreted, lied and nearly died. We now
say that the Science of Economics, or
Business, is the chief concern of humanity ❦
Business is intelligent, useful
activity. The word “busy-ness” was
coined during the time of Chaucer by
certain soldier-aristocrats, men of the
leisure class, who prided themselves
upon the fact that they did no useful
thing ❦ Men of power proved their
prowess by holding slaves, and these
slaves did all the work. To be idle
showed that one was not a slave. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
this word “business,” first flung in
contempt, like Puritan, Methodist and
Quaker, has now become a thing of
which to be proud. Idleness is the disgrace,
not busy-ness. ¶ The world can
be redeemed only through business;
for business means betterment, and no
business can now succeed that does not
add to human happiness. ¶ We believe
that only the busy person is happy,
and that systematic, daily, useful work
is man’s greatest blessing. We are a
nation of workers, builders, inventors,
creators, producers. We are the richest
country, per capita, in the world; and
our wealth has come from the farm,
the forest, the factory, the mine, the
sea. We have dug, plowed, pumped
smelted, refined, transported and manufactured ❦
We did not inherit our
wealth, neither have we laid tribute on
other countries, as did those earlier
civilizations. Any individual who uses
the word “commercial” as an epithet,
who regards business enterprise as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
synonymous with graft and greed, who
speaks of certain men as “self-made”
and others as “educated,” who gives
more attention to war than to peace,
who seeks to destroy rather than to
create and build up, is essentially un-American ❦
The word “education”
sometimes stands for idleness, but the
American Philosophy symbols work,
effort, industry. It means intelligent,
thoughtful, reasonable and wise busy-ness—helping
yourself by helping
others. ¶ The world’s greatest prizes in
the future will go to the businessman.
The businessman is our only scientist,
and to him we must look for a Science
of Economics that will eradicate poverty,
disease, superstition—all that dissipates
and destroys. The day is dawning!</p>

<p class="dropcap">I am told that hospitals,
jails, almshouses and insane-asylums
are for
people who are unable
to care for themselves
properly. Therefore, they are sent to
these places, where men and women,
specially delegated, spend their lives
looking after them. ¶ So it seems that
the incompetent, in addition to not adding
to the wealth of the world, actually
take competent people from a world of
usefulness to minister to them. After a
few years as a guard, the man is quite
as incompetent as are the prisoners—and
more so—because the prisoner<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
works and the guard does nothing but
guard. ¶ And for the man who works
there is a chance; but the man who
doesn’t is damned, body and soul.
Hospitals, prisons and poorhouses are
places where people live who can’t or
won’t work. These places do not cure
our bodily or social ills—they are palliatives,
all. They do not prevent incompetence
nor stop the production of the
weak and incompetent. Every year we
have to pull down our hospitals and
build greater. Ben Lindsey, Luther
Burbank, John Davey, Horace Fletcher,
all men essentially of one type, are
working to shut off the regular annual
crop of criminals ❦ Preachers have
preached their silly tales of where we
came from and where we are going to,
directing the attention of men from
this world to another, and with myth,
miracle, mystery—with dead languages,
dead ideas and dead formulas—have
scared the world stiff. That’s why we
are sick. ¶ We have bred from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
worst in the worst possible way, under
the worst conditions ❦ We have it
thundered at us from a million pulpits
that the indissoluble marriage-tie was
a sacred scheme, devised by God Almighty,
who also provided that women
shall be incarcerated in a kitchen. The
result has been the doormat wife, with
a liar for a husband—for men lie only
to inferiors and tyrants—and a brood
of legitimate candidates for hospitals,
poorhouses and prisons. ¶ Christianity
was absolutely supreme for a thousand
years. Did she abolish poverty, disease
and crime? Not exactly—these things
increased under Christian rule. And
Religion is not yet willing to step aside
and give Science a chance ❦ Revivalists
get a thousand children in a room and
play on their nervous sensibilities in
the name of the Gentle Christ, and then
the doctors vaccinate them with pus
from diseased animals, and we wonder
why they die or go insane! The Clerics
killed Ferrer because he was working<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
to make men free. ¶ Freedom means
responsibility. And responsibility means
the making of decisions. By deciding
for ourselves we grow, and this exercise
of the will in deciding what is best to
do and doing it is the only method of
attaining growth known in Nature. But
woman’s decisions have been made for
her by male man, and so low has she
sunk that millions of women are willing
that this should continue. The passion
for freedom is Nature’s cry for growth.
¶ A judge of the Supreme Court of the
State of New York once said to me:
“Divorce should be as free as marriage,
and if it were, there would be no more
separations than there are now. We
give men and women the right to put
their heads into a noose, but decline to
let them pull their heads out. Those
whom God hath joined together no man
can put asunder. Also, the word ‘illegitimate’
should be stricken from the
judicial record, forever. An act may
be illegitimate, but a child, never.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
¶ “Why don’t you talk like this in public?”
I asked. And the answer was, “If I
did, I’d lose my job inside of twenty-four
hours.” “Well,” I said, “I’ll say it for
you.” “If you do and mention my name
I’ll—but, say, you will not, you must
not quote me. You can agitate—I can
only conform ❦ We are ruled by the archaic.
You are working to make men free,
and only a free people can be a healthy,

<p class="dropcap">Children’s diseases
are a logical result of
children’s beatings ❦ To
shock, pain, grieve, anger
or violently suppress a
human being is to run a grave risk of
lowering that individual’s physical vitality
to a point where the person is an
easy prey for any disease that happens
along. That which interferes with the
vital functions, even in a transient way,
is not wise nor good. ¶ Extreme anger is
apt to be followed by lassitude or some
marked physical disturbance. In fact,
it is well known that hate secretes a
toxin which manifests itself in the
breath, and in the tissues ❦ What we
call a disease is a symptom of vitality<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
decreased to a point where the forces
of dissolution are active. A shock which
will blanch the cheek disturbs the circulation,
and interferes with the digestion.
¶ Perhaps the whipping did not
mutilate, but it angered and shocked
until a fever followed. Dyspepsia is a
matter of the nerves. Much of our bad
theology, if we could trace it, would be
found to have its rise in indigestion.
And that it has caused pathological
disturbances of countless varieties, from
catarrh to acute mania, is known to
every thinking physician. ¶ And of all
causes of sickness, I know of none that
has borne a greater crop of cosmic
cockleburs than the old-time plan of
whipping children. When Solomon put
forth that unwise saying, “Spare the
rod and spoil the child,” an extent of
harm was done the human race that no
pen can compute. That one statement
should have convinced every intelligent
person that the Bible was just like every
other book—good and bad in spots.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
If accepted literally, the Bible is an
atrocious book, false, obscene and misleading,
tending to insanity, disease and
death. Fortunately, we are now allowed
to take the Bible as the garbled literature
of a barbaric and superstitious past,
collected from many sources, and good
and bad, wise and silly, sublime and
vicious—all as the case may be. ¶ That
millions of parents have bolstered their
brutal tendency to punish and inflict
pain by that remark about sparing the
rod, every one knows. And always the
tendency to beat the little thing, too
weak to strike back, was more to ease
the feelings of the parent than to improve
and benefit the child. Moreover,
it was educating the child, for the
youngster grew up and inflicted upon
its own children all the horror that it
had, itself, endured. It was heir to the
brutality, heir to the Bible, heir to the
strap, birch, rod, ferrule and hairbrush,
so these were in daily use in all Christian
homes. ¶ In my childhood, I remember<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
a Baptist preacher who lived neighbor
to us ❦ This man was loud, lacrimose,
brutal, a devout Christian, and a preacher
of power, snatching many souls from
the burning. The way that gospel sharp
used to pass out his tidings of great joy
broke in on my childish fancies, so I
became convinced that if God was really
just, that pious, bawling beast who fed
fat on our chickens would go to hell,
sure. But I kept my suspicions to myself.
This preacher had a strap cut from a
side of sole-leather—a strap three feet
long, with tails, with which he used to
beat up one of his nine or ten children
every day ❦ From the baby wearing
diapers to a big boy of sixteen, and a
girl full-grown, they all got it. I have
heard their cries for mercy ring out on
a winter’s night when they would run
out into the yard to escape their pious
parent intent on saving their souls.
¶ Once, one of his daughters, a girl of
fifteen, spent ten cents for a blue ribbon,
and appeared in church with the ribbon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
in her hair. Her father saw her from
his place in the pulpit. He noted her
mark of pride ❦ He denounced her
before the congregation, and expressed
a hypocritical, pious pain that his own
flesh and blood should be guilty of such
devilish frivolity. Then he ordered her
out of the church. When he got home
after the service, he fell upon her with
the strap. It pained him, but he felt it
was his duty to correct her. The mother
was a sick and undone little creature,
who twice had twins, and bore at least
one baby a year, except the year when
her lord and master crossed the plains
and got alkalied. And this woman really
believed, too, that the children should
be punished, and so she had a way of
reporting them, thus, “I’ll tell your
father on you when he comes home!”
She, too, believed in Solomon, and she
believed also in her husband’s religion.
Poor thing, she was too busy bearing
babies to really think anything out for
herself ❦ But that Sunday afternoon,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
when her husband felt it his duty to
whip the daughter, the girl ran to the
mother and demanded protection. The
good man was laying on the strap, anywhere,
over the girl’s head, shoulders,
her arms and hands, although usually
he picked out some choice portion of
anatomy and did an artistic job. ¶ Yet
this time the girl fought back, and she
was only a slim slip of a thing. But now,
the womanhood in her was aroused.
She felt insulted. She struck, she bit,
she scratched, she screamed. And then
she ran to her mother ❦ Something
in the little yellow mother was now
aroused. Her child was being abused.
Well, what of it! Hadn’t she seen these
whippings going on daily for twenty
years? But this was different ❦ The
adolescent girl had only given way to
her innocent and natural desire to put
forth a little color and be beautiful.
Now it was brute man against woman.
The mother seized the strap. It was
jerked through her clenched hands with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
such violence that it took the skin with
it. The preacher had backed the girl
into a corner, and with one hand clutching
her hair was laying on the strap
with the other, in the name of the Lord.
The mother was behind. Suddenly she
seized a long-handled skillet that was
on the kitchen-stove, she swung it with
both hands, and it landed square on
the man’s head ❦ He was dazed, and
turned half-around. Then he got another
one. He was getting a kitchen shower.
One sharp edge of the skillet skinned
one of his ears and cut it half-off, as
Peter touched up the servant of the
High Priest. The blood ran in a stream.
The woman seeing the gore, and amazed
at her own temerity, fell in a dead
swoon. The girl escaped and ran over
to our house. My father and mother
hurried over, and, kid-like, I followed.
We found the preacher on his knees,
praying over his wife, begging God for
her recovery ❦ He told us he had
stumbled and fallen against the cook-stove.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
My father took a stitch in the
ecclesiastic souse, and washed off the
blood of the lamb ❦ The woman soon
recovered and was put to bed. The girl
took care of herself. She told my mother
the truth of the incident, but was
cautioned not to repeat it to others,
and she didn’t. ¶ The next Sunday the
holy man preached as usual, unctuous
and oily, smiling and smirking, thundering
ponderously betimes, warning us to
flee the wrath to come. ¶ This daughter
died at eighteen, of galloping consumption.
One of the boys achieved considerable
local fame as a horse-thief. I
believe he was the only one of that big
family who reached maturity, and this
was because he had a pachyderm hide
and a heart of gneiss ❦ Several of the
children died in babyhood, the rest ran
the gamut of about all the diseases in
the books. And finally, the Lord’s will
was done. A long row of little white
headstones in the village graveyard
marks where they sleep, freed from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
strap, awaiting a glorious resurrection
at the Last Great Day. ¶ What killed
them? The strap, I should say, carried
to its logical limit, with a plentiful lack
of love. Spare the rod and save the child,
for love is life, and hate is death. Love is
better than a cat-o’-nine-tails, and Solomon,
the wisest man who ever lived, was
a lobster—at least part of the time.</p>

<p><i>No quarter! We want all that you possess. We
will be content with nothing less than all that
you possess. We want in our hands the reins
of power and the destiny of mankind. Here are
our hands. They are strong hands. We are
going to take your governments, your palaces,
and all your purpled ease away from you, and
in that day you shall work for your bread even

runty clerk in your metropolises. Here are our
hands. They are strong hands.</i>—<i>Jack London.</i></p>

</div>

<p>The above is taken from
a postal card sent out by
the publishers of Jack
London’s books. Jack is
a Marxian Socialist all
day long, and he is much more frank
than most of his party. All the other
Socialists I ever met, alternately admit
and deny that what they want is a
division of property ❦ Jack London<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
stands by his guns and declares, “We
want all you possess.” And when he
says “you” he means the people who
own property. He is talking to the
owners and managers of the “tools,” by
which he means the railroads, mills,
shops, stores, factories, mines and steamships.
That is to say, Jack is going to take
things away from the present owners
and give these things to “we.” Jack assumes
that property in the hands of the
Socialist would be much better managed
than it is now in the hands of those who
own it. ¶ This threat of Jack’s would
be a tragic thing if Jack and his pals
were really going to do all they say they
are. But they are not going to do anything
but talk. That is their “hold.”
Folks who can, do; those who can’t, chin.
Jack is a writing tramp who roams the
world for thrills and copy. He is kindly,
intelligent, amusing, indolent, and absolutely
without the power to manage
anything—even his own tongue. He is
a good fellow; and he makes folks think.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
In fact, he is the sparker to this paragraph.
Jack made me think, he made
me mad, he made me laugh, and he
made me write. Personally I like the
rogue—he is most companionable, especially
if you have no work to do.
¶ The tendency of property of every
sort is towards depreciation and dissolution.
Only eternal vigilance and tireless
industry keep a manufacturing plant or
a farm effective ❦ Jack does not know
this. Jack thinks that to own property
is to be immune from work. The truth
is, ownership is a responsibility and a
burden. Most of the Socialists I know
do not work—they only talk about
work. ¶ What they want is an orthodox
heaven of ease, where the harps are
always in tune and the robes are always
laundered. If Jack could take away the
property from those who have it and
set them to work like peasants and
“runty clerks,” then the Socialists
would live in “purpled ease,” as Jack
and many other childish, silly folks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
think that rich people do now. ¶ There
is an “idle rich” class, but it is a very
small class, and it is not made up of the
people who manage things. It is made
up of remittance-men—and some of
these are Socialists, who play at equality,
badger the busy, and patronize the
poor. Leave the idle rich to Nemesis.
Disease and death are at their heels.
¶ The men who operate our great
enterprises—mills, factories, elevators,
banks and department-stores—know
nothing of ease. Their working-hours
are not limited by the whistle ❦ They
sweat blood to meet payrolls and to
keep the wheels of trade revolving.
Modern business is a most exacting
taskmaster. It says, “Thou shalt have
no other gods before me.” It demands
every ounce of energy its devotee has.
The thought of a “good time” is not
for the businessman. He works, and
works eternally. He works because he
can’t stop ❦ And this is the man the
Socialists are going to send to the fields!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
Jack London’s view of railroading is
only from the bumpers. His philosophy
can not deceive the section-hands, nor
the train-crews, nor the operators, nor
the managers. They work, and they
work with care, precision, energy and
economy. Each one does the thing he
can do best. That is what we all do.
If Jack’s hands were the strong hands
he pretends, they would be grabbing
plow-handles or a shovel, instead of
reaching for a hand-me-out ❦ If the
hands of Jack and his friends were
strong enough, they would own this
property towards which they now look
with lustful eyes. ¶ The world will be
redeemed; it is being redeemed. It is
being redeemed not by those who shake
the red rag of wordy warfare, who
threaten and demand, but by its entrepreneurs—its
workers, its inventors, its
toilers—the men and women who do
the duty that lies nearest them. ¶ The
fallacy of the Jack philosophy lies in the
assumption that the industries of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
world would be much better managed
by Jack and his kith than by the men
who are now at the helm ❦ In other
words, Jack’s claim is that Socialists are
a peculiar, separate and distinct class
of able, unselfish, competent persons
with hands especially strong, who accidentally
are out of the game, but who
are soon to take possession of things
and run everything in such a way that
Society will be blessed and benefited as
never before. ¶ The fact is, Socialists
are not a separate and distinct class.
We are all children of Adam and Eve,
and the differences in us are more apparent
than real ❦ We all have our
limitations—read Carlyle! The weaknesses
of humanity are inherent in
Socialists—only perhaps in greater degree.
Their doctrine of reaching Utopia
through firing the men who now manage
things is the doctrine of despair. Fabian
Socialism is something else—it is opportunism ❦
It does what it can, now.
It does not wait for a revolution—rather<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
it believes in evolution ❦ We climb
step by step. Fabian Socialism does not
preach class hatred. In fact, it does not
recognize that either the “class” or the
“mass” exists. People who belong to
one so-called class today are in another
tomorrow. Most of our so-called predatory
rich wiggled up out of the mass—and
they may be poor again ❦ Many
of the poor will be rich. Watch the immigrants
landing at Ellis Island. Can
you prophesy to what “class” these
boys and girls—curious, quaint, half-frightened—will
belong twenty years
from now? Many of them will be contractors,
lawyers, bankers, scientists,
doctors, teachers—it is all a matter of
individual energy, intelligence and desire,
modified by the antics of the gods
of Chance. There is no conspiracy in
America to hold people down and under.
Class hatred, represented by Marxian
Socialism, says there is. There is nothing
so savage, cruel and blindly unjust as
class hatred. ¶ I’ve been accused of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
class hatred because I make statements
from time to time that seem to reveal
a lack of appreciation for the three
learned professions. Granted that I do,
it is not the man I criticize—it is the
office. Doctors, lawyers and preachers
are men, caught in a certain environment,
trying to win the world’s plaudits
and plunder in a certain way ❦ I may
consider the way a mistaken one, but I
surely do not hate the man. And the fact
that I have hundreds of close friends
among the professions proves that I am
not entirely misunderstood in this matter ❦
Doctors are men. Lawyers are
men. Preachers are men. So, also, are
judges. Marxian Socialists are men,
and all these are very much like the
people with whom they mix and associate ❦
Rogue clients evolve rogue
lawyers to do their work; fool patients
evolve fool doctors; and superstitious,
silly people in the pew secrete a pretentious,
punk party in the pulpit. For
the man, himself, I have only admiration,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
respect and love—and sometimes pity.
I may despise his business and some of
his acts, but how can I hate the man,
when I realize that his life is a part of
the Great One from which mine is derived?
This man may quit his business
and take up something else. ¶ The criminal
is not wholly a criminal—he is
only a criminal at times. Some of his
impulses are good, and most of them
may be excellent; but one mistaken act
will brand him forever as a criminal in
the world’s assize. ¶ Under the same
conditions, if I were of the same quality
and temper, I would have done the
same ❦ If I criticize lawyers, doctors
and preachers, it is simply because there
courses through my veins a quality and
kind of corpuscle which fits me eminently
for success either as a lawyer, doctor
or preacher. “A hair, perhaps, divides
the false and true,” says old Omar.
¶ Yes, and I missed becoming a practising
physician by a hair. Had I gone into
Medicine I would have had a team of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
bays, a coon driver, and a whisker that
would have put all the other doctors in
my town to the bad. I have the fingers
of a diagnostician, a voice that soothes,
a presence that heals. If you didn’t have
it, I could convince both myself and you
that you had. Then I would have cut
into your cosmos to find out who was
right—and I would have charged you
five hundred dollars for the operation.
If I were wrong in my diagnosis, you
would never have known the difference,
for on occasion I can be discreet. ¶ The
law is a game that lures: it isn’t a
matter of securing justice—not that.
Truth has a secondary place in the
practise of law, and only very ignorant
folks imagine otherwise. The law is a
game, and you play to win. The whole
thing is fascinating. It is a clash of wits—mind
matching mind. As a lawyer, I
would have quibbled you six nights and
days together; and I would have been a
legal lallapaloosa. ¶ Bill Reedy writes,
“We are all touched with the essence of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
the thing against which we strive.” And
Bill is sometimes right. That is all we
can expect, even from the wisest and
best of men, and Bill is both ❦ Yes, I
would take kindly to the law, for guff,
bluff and stuff come easily within my
grasp. I can cross-buttock a fact; side-step
an equity; befuddle a judge—some
judges; kerflumix a jury; juggle with
justice; put reason astride of a barb-wire
fence; and prevent a witness from
keeping his oath to tell the truth, the
whole truth and nothing but the truth.
And a fat fee would always reanimate
any flagging zeal I might have as to the
justice of my client’s cause. ¶ As for
the pulpit, I would take it now, were it
not so securely fastened down—hypocrisy,
gush, glibness, Chicago Tongue,—yes,
let Billy Sunday look to his
laurels! I, too, could tear a passion to
tatters and make the judicious grieve.
I could hypnotize myself into a belief
that souls were “lost,” like collar-buttons
under a bureau, and I was the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
one man to rescue them ❦ Sure! Especially
am I qualified for making Pastoral
Calls—or I was once. Also, I have
great capacity for chicken-pie, pretense,
cheap social honors, and the applause
of the unthinking. As a Churchman,
reversed haberdashery would have done
me proud; breeks would become me,
for my shanks have individuality; and
a dinky hat would set off my sky-piece
in a way not only to arouse curiosity
but mirth. Let Dean Hart beware—his
job is not so secure as he thinks!
¶ Doctor Samuel Johnson was for a
time a member of Parliament in the
capacity of cub reporter. One certain
speech he reported, and when the gentleman
who had made the speech read the
report he didn’t exactly recognize it.
So he went to Johnson and said, “Look
’ere, young feller, I didn’t say that.”
“Certainly not,” said Johnson, “certainly
not; but that is what you should have
said!” ❦ In recounting his reportorial
experiences, Johnson was once asked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
this question: “What kind of men are
there in the House of Commons?” And
Johnson replied, “Take the first fifty
men you find walking up Fleet Street.”
Johnson knew that all men, regardless
of their condition in life, are, at heart,
very much alike. ¶ And when Fate has
flung a man into a certain situation, the
man will, if it is a place of some honor,
give himself all the credit for having
attained it. If it is a position that perhaps
carries no honor, the party will
always blame some one else for putting
him there. We credit ourselves for our
successes; we blame others for our faults.
Also, we justify ourselves in everything
we do ❦ And wise men see plainly
that this self-justification is a part of
Nature’s great law of self-preservation.
The exaggerated Ego is a primal necessity.
Good men all and everywhere
multiply the value of their work by ten.
¶ Success in life consists in convincing
yourself that you are the whole cheese,
and then getting the world to accept<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
your view. Rostand’s rooster was fully
assured in his own mind that the sun
would not come up if he did not crow.
The hens being told this by the rooster
cackled it back to him, and it became
a crystallized part of the orthodox
Zeitgeist ❦ And it would have so remained
for all time, but for an accident—an
accident of love, when a guinea-hen
became enamored of the boss of the
barnyard. So Life is a paradox—and
love is not only illusion, but it is also the
great enlightener. ¶ Now, I know Jack
London; I know the proletariat; I know
the “predatory rich.” And this I know,
that so far as happiness is concerned
each and all of them have an equal portion ❦
The struggle in getting out of
the mass has given Jack’s predatory
party a certain power, but he has paid
for it with his peace of mind, and has
to struggle to hold it. “Purpled ease”
is a thing that exists only in Jack’s
mental vacuum ❦ That is where the
tramp has the start of the millionaire.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
The tramp can dream it; the other
fellow has no time even to think it.
¶ When John Wesley saw the condemned
criminal being taken to Tyburn
Tree, he turned to his friend and exclaimed,
“But for the grace of God,
there goes John Wesley!” When Walt
Whitman looked upon the wounded
and dying soldier, he said, “I am that
man!” Emerson wrote in his <i>Essay
on Justice</i>, “I have in me the capacity
for every crime.” ¶ And here is what I
say to Jack London: If you and your
pals were in possession of the tools of
trade, you would commit all the so-called
crimes of which you accuse the
industrial leaders, and more. The fact
that your heart is full of hate proves
your unfitness to govern. ¶ These men
now in power have climbed step by step
to their present position, and at every
step had to prove their worth, before
they were allowed to go on. These tools
of which you speak are sharp, and men
like you, unskilled in their use, would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
cut others with them, and they in turn
would take the tools and cut your head
off. ¶ Your hands are not as strong as
you imagine. The strength of the hands
of men is not proven by assertion—it
is proven by use. How far can you put
the shot? Power unrestrained is always
tragic. The world is held in place by
the opposition of forces. The men in
power are ballasted by responsibility,
as never before in history. You have
your use as an agitator; so go it, Jack,
and say your say. ¶ That fly on the
wheel of the chariot of Achilles said,
“Oh, just see what a dust we do kick
up!” ¶ And this remark of the fly has
added to the gaiety of nations. But get
enough flies on the chariot of Achilles
and not a wheel revolves. The Egyptians
in Moses’ time battled with swarms of
flies, when the flies scored home-runs
and base-hits. Self-interest and the tug
of inertia have hypnotized you, Jack,
until you, being down in the gutter—through
choice—see only your side.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
Yet, your barbaric yawp is being heard,
and I am your antipodal organ, passing
it along. ¶ Meanwhile you ride on the
bumpers provided by the Trusts, and
these bumpers carry you forward to
your destination. The pie you eat is
made by the Pie Trust, yet you find it
palatable and ask for more. If the Pie
Trust didn’t make good pies and sell
them at a fair valuation, housewives
would make their own pies. Or they
might find pie-timber too expensive,
and then you would go pieless ❦ The
great consolidated industries serve society,
and their very existence turns on
their ability to minister and to help.
That which does not serve, dies. If the
Trusts overcharge they invite competition
and dissolution. ¶ Success lies in
co-operation and reciprocity, and the
hope of the future is in the fact that the
world knows it. We can’t go back to
chaos, and start over. We must go on.
Light lies ahead, not behind. We are
not going to take off the train-crews,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
and put the tramps in possession. There
are accidents occasionally now, but
there would be more then. Safety lies
in getting rid of the tramps. One wide-awake,
vigilant man at the switch is
worth more to society than all the
tramps who ride the brakebeams. Get
to work, Jack, and if you can’t find the
job you want, then take the one you
can get! To prove yourself able to rastle
a big job, get busy and take care of a
little one. Power does not reveal itself
in scolding. And with all your getting,
get busy! ¶ Yours for the Evolution!</p>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-h.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="">
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Here’s a thought, Dearie,
that I give to you because
I haven’t a very firm
grasp upon it myself. In
order to clarify my mind
I explain to you. And thus, probably,
do I give you something which is already
yours. Grateful? Of course you are—there!
¶ The thought is this—but before
I explain it let me tell of what a man saw
in a certain cottage in Denmark. And
it was such a little whitewashed cottage,
too, with a single, solitary rosebush
clambering over the door! An Artist,
his Wife and their Little Girl lived there.
There were four rooms, only, in this
cottage—a kitchen, a bedroom, a workroom
and the Other Room ❦ The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
kitchen was for cooking, the bedroom
for sleeping, the workroom for work,
and the Other Room was where the
occupants of the cottage received their
few visitors. When the visitors remained
for tea or lunch, the table was spread
in the Other Room, but usually the
Artist, his Wife and their Little Girl
ate their meals in the kitchen, or in
Summer on the porch at the back of
the house. ¶ Now the Artist painted
pictures, and his Wife carved beautiful
shapes in wood; but they didn’t make
much money—in fact, no one seemed
to know them at all. They didn’t have
funds to accumulate a library, and
perhaps would not if they had. But still
they owned all the books written by
Georg Brandes. These books were kept
in a curious little case, which the Artist
and his Wife, themselves, had made ❦
And before the case of books was an
ancient Roman lamp, suspended from
the ceiling by a chain. And the lamp
was kept always lighted, night and day.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
Each morning before they tasted food,
the man and his Wife read from Georg
Brandes, and then they silently refilled,
trimmed and made the lamp all clean
and tidy ❦ Oho! why, your eyes are
filling with tears—how absurd!—and
you want to hear more about the Artist
and his Wife and the Little Girl! But,
bless me! that is all I know about them.
¶ However, I do know that Georg
Brandes is one of the Apostles of the
Better Day. His message is a plea for
beauty—that is to say, harmony. He
would have us live lives of simplicity,
truth, honesty and gentleness ❦ He
would have us work for harmony and
love, instead of for place and power.
Georg Brandes is an individualist and
a symbolist. He thinks all of our belongings
should mean much to us, and
that great care should be exercised in
selection. We need only a few things,
but each of these things should suggest
utility, strength, harmony and truth.
All of our actions must be suggestive of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
peace and right ❦ Not only must we
speak truth, but we must live it. Our
lives should be consecrated to the good:
lives consecrated to Truth and Beauty.
Consecrated Lives! And so this Artist
and his Wife I told you of were priests
of Beauty, and their Little Girl was a
neophyte; and the room where the
Roman lamp burned was filled with the
holiness of beauty, and no unkind
thought or wrong intent could exist
there. Consecrated Lives! that is the
subject. There is a brotherhood of such,
and you can reach out and touch finger-tips
with the members the round world
over. ¶ Beauty is an Unseen Reality—an
attempt to reveal a spiritual condition.
Members of this Brotherhood of
Consecrated Lives do not take much
interest in Political Policies; and all the
blatant blowing of brass horns that are
used on ’Change, in pulpits, or by
Fourth of July speakers are to them
trivial and childish. They distinguish
at once the note of affectation, hypocrisy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
and pretense in it all. They know its
shallowness, its selfishness and its extremely
transient quality. ¶ Yet your
man of the Consecrated Life may mix
with the world, and do the world’s business,
but for him it is not the true
world, for hidden away in his heart he
keeps burning a lamp before a shrine
dedicated to Love and Beauty ❦ The
Adept only converses at his best with
an Adept, and he does this through self-protection.
To hear the world’s coarse
laugh in his Holy of Holies—no! and
so around him is a sacred circle, and
within it only the Elect are allowed to
enter. To join this brotherhood of Consecrated
Lives requires no particular
rites of initiation—no ceremonial—no
recommendations ❦ You belong when
you are worthy. But do not for a moment
imagine you have solved the difficulty
when you have once entered. To pride
yourself on your entrance is to run the
danger of finding yourself outside the
pale with password hopelessly forgotten.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
Within the esoteric lines are circles and
inner circles, and no man yet has entered
the inmost circle where the Ark of the
Covenant is secreted. All is relative.
¶ But you know you belong to the
Brotherhood when you feel the absolute
nothingness of this world of
society, churches, fashion, politics and
business; and realize strongly the
consciousness of the Unseen World of
Truth, Love and Beauty ❦ The first
emotion on coming into the Brotherhood
is one of loneliness and isolation.
You pray for comradeship, and empty
arms reach out into the darkness. But
gradually you awaken to the thought
that you are one of many who hope
and pray alike; and that slowly this
oneness of thought and feeling is making
its impress felt. Then occasionally
you meet one of your own. This one
may be socially high or low, rich or
poor, young or old, man or woman—but
you recognize each other on sight
and hold sweet converse ❦ Then you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
part, mayhap, never to meet again,
but you are each better, stronger, nobler
for the meeting. ¶ Consecrated Lives!
You meet and you part, but you each
feel a firmer impulse to keep the light
burning—the altar light to Truth,
Simplicity and Beauty. No other bond
is required than that of devotion to
Truth, the passion of listening in the
Silence, the prayer for Wholeness and
Harmony, the earnest desire to have
your life reflect the Good. All man-made
organization would be fatal to the
sweet, subtle and spiritual qualities of
the Brotherhood ❦ For organization
means officers, judicial robes, livery,
arbitrary differentiation, and all the vile
and foolish claptrap of place and power.
It means the wish to dictate, select and
exclude, and this means jealousy, prejudice
and bitterness—fifteen candidates
for a vacant bishopric with heartaches
to match! ❦ No organization ever contained
within its ranks the best. Organization
is arbitrary and artificial; it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
born of selfishness; and at the best is a
mere matter of expediency. The Brotherhood
of Consecrated Lives admits all who
are worthy, and all who are excluded,
exclude themselves. ¶ If your Life is to
be a genuine consecration, you must be
free. Only the free man is truthful; only
the heart that is free is pure. How many
compose this Brotherhood—who shall
say? There are no braggart statisticians,
no paid proselytes with their noisy
boastings. Two constitute a congregation,
and where they commune is a
temple. Many belong who do not know
it; others there be who think they belong,
and are so sure of it that they do
not. ¶ But the Brotherhood is extending
its lines; and what think you the
earth will be like when the majority of
men and women in it learn that to be
simple and honest and true is the part
of wisdom, and that to work for Love
and Beauty is the highest good? ❦</p>

<p class="dropcap">My old co-ed college chum,
Winifred Black, has
recently propounded this
question, “Why are
husbands lobsters?” So
I’ll explain to Winifred the cause of this
sad state which devolutes a lover into
a lobster. It’s like this: the rule is that
the male of the genus homo is never any
better than he has to be. Having said
this much, let me further add that this
truth also applies to the female of the
genus homo. ¶ A marriage that is practically
indissoluble gives the man security
in his position. He is not obliged
to win favors—he merely exercises his
rights. As for the woman, she has him,
and when she reminds him of the fact,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
hell is to pay. The man who stands on
his rights, thinks about his rights, talks
of his rights, belongs to the Lobsteria.
He has ceased to be either loving or
lovable. The only right any man should
have is the right to be decent—that is,
to be agreeable and useful ❦ One of
Nature’s chief intents in sex is to bring
about beauty, grace and harmony. The
flowing mane and proud step of the
horse, the flamboyant tail of the peacock,
the song of the bird, the perfume
and color of the flowers, are all sex
manifestations, put forth with intent
to attract, please and fascinate. Charm
of manner is a sex attribute which has
become a habit. The creative principle
in all art is a secondary sex manifestation.
The average married man feels that
he is immune from the necessity of winning,
pleasing, charming—he owns property.
He’s a Turk! And from the Turk
and the Comet, good Lord, deliver us!
¶ Public Opinion is the great natural restraining
force. We are ruled by Public<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
Opinion, not by statute law. If statute
law expresses the Zeitgeist it is well,
but often law hampers and restrains
Public Opinion ❦ Divorce laws are obsolete
in their character, and should die
the death. A marriage that can not be
dissolved tends to tyranny. There is a
rudimentary something in man that
makes him a tyrant—that divides
humanity into master and slave—and
to these barbaric instincts we are heir.
The business of civilization is to make
men free. And freedom means responsibility.
¶ The curse of marriage is that it
makes the parties immune from very
much of that gentle consideration which
freedom bestows. Freedom in divorce
is the one thing that will transform the
marital boor into a gentleman. ¶ Freedom
in divorce is the one thing that will
abolish the domestic steam-roller. Freedom
in divorce is the one thing that will
correct the propensity to nag, in both
male and female. We gain freedom by
giving it. We hold love by giving it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
away. To enslave another is to enslave
yourself. Constancy, unswerving and
eternal, is only possible where men and
women are free. ¶ Marriage was first a
property-right. The woman was owned
by the man. She was a chattel. He had
the right of taking her life if she attempted
to escape, or was otherwise
unruly ❦ Then the priests came in and
declared marriage a sacred rite. They
brazenly declared that the marriage
where they did not officiate was no
marriage at all—that it was a base and
unholy alliance, and that the children
were illegitimate. ¶ The relationship of
man and woman was to them a sin and
a shame, but by their approval it was
redeemed and made proper and right.
To grant a divorce was to admit that
the rite did not “take.” Hence, divorce
was tabu. The Church isn’t interested
in divorce—all the church is fighting
for is to hold its position. Then comes
civil marriage, which is a contract between
the man and the woman from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
which neither party can withdraw without
laying the whole matter before the
courts—and the newspapers. And the
sacredness of contract takes the place
of the sacredness of the rite. “I would
hold my friend by no stronger tie than
the virtue that is in my soul,” said the
gentle Emerson. ¶ Easy divorce would
make divorce unnecessary in a vast
number of cases, because it would put
men and women on their good behavior,
and thus do away with incompatibility.
That which tends to increase charm of
manner can not be bad; that which
tends to conform a lover into a lobster
is not wholly good. ¶ All over the United
States there is a general demand for a
uniform divorce law. This is right and
well. And the way to bring about this
uniformity is to do away with all divorce
laws. ¶ If divorce were free, it would
probably be no more frequent than it is
now. Marriage should be difficult, and
divorce easy. As it is now, any preacher
will marry anything to anybody for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
fifty cents ❦ Nightly, clergymen are
aroused from sleep to marry couples out
of the second-story window. Marriages
occur in circus-rings, balloons, show-windows,
and yesterday I heard of a
wedding in an automobile going on the
high clutch at speed-limit, with Papa’s
car opening up the cut-off close behind
in hot pursuit ❦ Bum, lum, de-dum!
Marriage is so serious a matter that it
should not be entered upon lightly. The
old plan of publishing the bans was
founded on commonsense. The couple
about to embark should be compelled
to take a full month to think about it,
and persons absolutely unfit should be
debarred. But once entered upon, just
two people know whether the venture
is a success—and they are the man
and the woman. In the name of freedom,
let the only parties who are vitally
interested decide the issue. ¶ Divorce is
a heroic remedy for an awful condition.
It is the culmination of a fearful tragedy ❦
I know of nothing worse than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
incompatibility. There is no hell equal to
the hell of having to live with a person
who is not your own. Either party who
wants a divorce should have it. And the
proof that it is desired should be reason
sufficient for granting it ❦ Make way
for liberty! It isn’t the law that brings
a man and a woman together, and no law
should be invoked to hold them together.
¶ The police should keep their heavy
hands off. What can an outside party
know of this most subtle and delicate
of all human relations! The love of man
for woman and of woman for man is the
most powerful and persistent force in
the universe. And man in his greed has
seized upon it and attempted to regulate
it from Harrisburg, Hartford and Helena.
Now there are many folks who
think it should be looked after from the
District of Columbia. God help us all—just
lift off the roofs and take a look at
Social Washington some night at four
A. M.! ¶ The lawyer here steps in and
becomes as insistent and as dogmatic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
as the priest. Once you could marry
only through the ministrations of a
priest; now you can secure a divorce
only through the services of a lawyer—often
a dozen are employed, counting
both sides. ¶ “Why make life difficult,
complex and heavy?” cries Emerson.
And well does he ask the question ❦
This supreme thing in life, our love, can
not be regulated by man’s law ❦ The
Supreme Power that made, fashioned
and gave it to us provided for its automatic
regulation. ¶ When love, honor
and respect die, it is time in the name
of purity to part. No priest can consecrate
the holy relationship of a man
and a woman, but God can and does.
Love is the only consecration—and
love is enough ❦ To imagine that
God should endow us with this mighty
passion, and then leave its regulation
to those who govern us for a consideration,
is an insult to the Divine Intelligence
of which we are a part ❦ The
mating of a man and a woman is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
one sacred thing in life. And left alone
it is lovely and true in all its attributes.
In law, they will tell you that “the
plaintiff has all the rights his contract
gives him and no more.” In Nature, a
man should have all the rights which
love bestows, and no more. And when
I speak of man I mean woman, too, for
there is the male man and the female
man ❦ I believe in equality—the
equality of Nature, or, if you please, of
God. I do not believe in the law interposing
and giving a man rights and a
woman privileges. Neither do I understand
why the money a woman earns
should belong to a man, unless we first
grant the righteousness of master and
slave, and frankly admit that the man
owning the woman, also owns <i>per se</i>
all that she produces, including her
children ❦ God has decided who the
children belong to—they belong to
the woman who bore them and whose
body nourished them. But man steps
in and makes laws about a mother’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
instincts. ¶ Men and women mate, and
being mated cleave together until death
do them part—and longer. They whom
God has joined together no man can put
asunder. The mischievous meddling of
man leads to a condition where the
parties think they own each other. This
is slavery. Many married men treat any
other woman with more respect than
they treat their wives. ¶ The gallantry
that holds through gentle treatment and
just is gone when the man thinks he
holds a warranty-deed for the property.
To be free you must be on your good
behavior. And do not for a moment
imagine that a man would leave his
mate if law did not manacle him to her.
He is held by an unseen silken cord as
strong as Fate, as constant as Life, as
persistent as Death. “Whither thou
goest, I will go: and thy people shall
be my people.” ¶ The divine attraction
which brings the right man and the right
woman together must be trusted as
strong and sufficient enough to hold<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
them. When you treat them as rats
baited into a trap, from which escape
is impossible, you dissolve the main
idea and interpose the thought of escape.
¶ And this is what makes so many
married men and women stray in their
sleep and tread the border-land of folly.
I would hold my mate by the supreme
integrity of my love for her, and by no
other bond. And this once fixed in the
minds of men and women would make
for constancy. ¶ Nothing is more terrible
in life than to break and sunder human
relations ❦ To be true to your own is
the natural thing, because it is the right
thing. It is the only policy that pays.
Happiness lies in loyalty. This applies
to any field of human endeavor. The
race knows it now for the first time in
history. Truth is the new virtue, and
Truth is a virtue because it reduces the
perplexities of life and brings good results.
¶ The love of man for woman
and of woman for man, and of both for
their children, is a divine instinct ❦<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
When you bolster and brace it by political
blacksmiths and shuddering shysters,
you doubt its constancy, and, what is
worse, you suggest the doubt to the
very people you seek to fetter ❦ The
greatest line ever written by Humboldt
was this: “The Universe is governed by
Law.” But he did not refer to the laws
of man ❦ He referred to the laws of
Nature, or, if you please, the laws of
God, although Humboldt in his latter
years never used the word “God.” I
believe in the blessed trinity of Man,
Woman and Child. These to me express
Divinity. Left alone the woman would
be the companion, friend and helpmeet
of the man, not his slave, pet, plaything,
drudge, doormat and scullion. ¶ Happiness
lies in equality. The effort you put
forth to win the woman, you should be
compelled to exercise through life in order
to hold her. And you will hold her by so
long as Love kisses the lips of Death,
and the dimpled hands of the babe
encircle the neck of its father ❦ The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
house of the harlot exists because love
is gyved, fettered, blindfolded and sold
in the marketplaces. There is nothing
so pulls on the heartstrings of the normal,
healthy man as the love for wife and
child ❦ Always and forever he wears
them in his heart of hearts. To imagine
that he would forsake them for the
husks of license, unless looked after by
Jaggers and Jaggers, is to doubt the
Wisdom of the Creator. In our hearts
Divine Wisdom implanted the seeds of
loyalty and right. These are a part of
the great plan of self-preservation. We
do not walk off the cliff, because we
realize that to do so would mean death.
¶ Make men and women free, and they
will travel by the Eternal Guiding Stars.
That which makes for self-respect in
men and women, putting each on his
good behavior, increasing the sum of
good-will and lessening hate, will have
a most potent influence on future generations.
I can not imagine a worse handicap
than to be tumbled into life by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
incompatible parents and be brought up
in an atmosphere of strife. “We have
bred from the worst in the worst possible
way, and the result is a race of scrubs,”
says Alfred Russel Wallace. ¶ All that
tends to tyranny in parents manifests
itself in slavish traits in the children.
Freedom is a condition of mind, and
the best way to secure it is to breed it.
So I say, make marriage difficult by demanding
notification and a pause; then
make divorce free on application of
either party ❦ Do you remember the
woman who wanted a divorce if she
couldn’t get it, and if she could, did
not want it? No one wants a divorce
from his own ❦ This would be the one
horrible and appalling thing in life. Let
life be automatic. Make room for the
Divine. And in this article I have only
stated what all thinking men and women
know and believe, but which they—wisely—decline
to say or even admit.
Therefore, I have said it for them. We
will now listen to the Anvil Chorus.</p>

<div>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">I am in receipt of a very
interesting letter from the
Reverend A. B. Taylor,
Lakeside, New York, in
which he says that he
reads <i>The Fra</i> with much pleasure and
profit, and often receives valuable help
therefrom in compiling his sermons.
Doctor Taylor is an orthodox Methodist,
and the fact that I am able to express
for him, in degree, many of the
things he holds as truth is one of the
encouraging signs of the times. It is
frank, friendly and beautiful in Doctor
Taylor to write me his acknowledgments.
But after writing the letter he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
adds a postscript. I might say that I
have a suspicion he wrote the beautiful
letter in order to add the postscript,
but I will not. Here is the P.S.: “One
thing I do not like, and can not comprehend,
is why you so wrongfully advocate
the taxing of church property.”
¶ Then he encloses a column clipping
from <i>The Christian Work and Evangelist</i>,
wherein the reasons for exemption of
church property from taxation are fully
set forth. Very seldom does one get the
entire argument at first hand, but here
it all is, skilfully presented ❦ I give
it in its entirety: “The worst enemy
New York has, or any city has, is the
perennial critic who would tax the
churches. Some interesting correspondence
has recently been going on in one
of the New York papers over this matter.
Some one by the name of Hubbard discovered
that there were several million
dollars’ worth of property in churches
which was untaxed. The critic supported
his arguments by statements that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
churches are not direct public servants,
as are schools and hospitals; that they
exist to teach certain doctrines of their
own, differing among themselves, and
which have no direct relation to the
public good—some of the doctrines,
indeed, being pernicious, according to
this critic. The short-sightedness of all
this is apparent to the most superficial
mind. The policy of taxing the churches
would be almost suicidal to any town
or city. The churches save New York
fifty times what the city loses in taxes
from them. Here are a few facts which
when perceived stop all such talk at
once: The Church is the greatest police
force in the community. The Roman
Catholic Church alone—we mention
that Church because it practises the
negative doctrine of restraint more than
do the Protestant churches—restrains
hundreds of thousands of men and
women from petty crimes that would
cost New York more than all her courts
and police and jails and prisons have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
cost her for years. Take the churches
out of New York for ten years and it
would be an unsafe city to live in, and
the expense of administering its criminal
courts and prisons would bankrupt
it. As a matter of fact, the teaching of
any particular theological doctrine is the
smallest part of any work the churches
do ❦ Go into any church in New York
and you will find that fully three-fourths
of all the efforts are being directly
expended in making good citizens. In
Sunday school the children are being
taught honesty, purity, brotherhood,
ambition and the unselfish life. Fully
two-thirds of the sermons of the average
preacher are direct inspirations to the
moral life or instructions in ethics. We
venture to say that had our friend
collected fifty of the sermons preached
in New York last Sunday he would have
found forty-nine which dealt with practical
religious life to one on the doctrine,
say, of the future life. ¶ Of course, there
are millions of people who have found<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
in their experience that the ‘peculiar
doctrines,’ as our friends call them,
produce the highest type of citizenship.
As a matter of fact, the main efforts of
the churches of New York are put on
producing honest and altruistic men ❦
Heaven only knows what would become
of the city if its one thousand four
hundred churches were crippled by great
taxes. It is bad enough now. The police
service the churches render New York
saves the city millions every year. The
service of furnishing her with honest
and unselfish men can not be put in
numbers. There are none large enough.”
¶ It will please be noticed that the
editor of <i>The Christian Work and Evangelist</i>
starts his article by informing us
who the worst enemy of New York or
any city actually is. This worst enemy,
according to my Christian colleague, is
the critic who would tax the churches.
Thus, before he attempts to reply to
the critic, he denounces the critic as not
only an enemy of the State, but its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
worst enemy. Grafters, thieves, dealers
in dope, procurers, sweat-shop fiends,
murderers, all take second place: the
worst enemy of a city—any city—is
the man who advocates the taxation of
church property. The editor himself is
a Christian, a church-member and a
clergyman. Does he stand as a sample
of the head, hand and heart of the
modern church-member? ❦ I think so.
He is a man of education, of position,
honored and respected in his denomination.
And he tells us that people who
disagree with him in a matter of finance
are not only the enemies of the State,
but its worst enemies. “A traitor to God
is a traitor to his country.” Thus did
religious fanaticism once link the heretic
and the traitor as one ❦ To disagree
with the prevailing religion was to be
regarded as the foe of society. How hard
the tyrants die! ¶ Yet many clergymen
believe that it would be better to put
church property on an absolute parity
with all other property. In fact, many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
churches now voluntarily pay taxes.
The great and influential congregation
presided over by Rabbi Leonard Levy
of Pittsburgh requested the assessors
to tax their synagogue at its cost
valuation of three hundred thousand
dollars ❦ In Toronto is a Baptist church—the
Jarvis Street Baptist Church, I
believe—that has paid taxes on its
property for more than twenty years,
because the congregation voting on the
question decided that an evasion of
taxes on the part of a church because it
did “good” was really no better than
the exemption of an individual for the
same reason. ¶ The enemy of the State,
forsooth, is the man who asks some one
to pay a few paltry dollars for police
and fire protection! ❦ Naturally, one
might say the enemy of the State is the
man who refuses to pay his quota of
expense for the maintenance of the
Government machinery. ¶ The editor
of <i>The Christian Work and Evangelist</i>
is a clergyman ❦ He is paid by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
religious denomination he serves. This
denomination has large holdings of real
estate, upon which it pays no taxes. If
it paid taxes it would not have so much
money to pay clergymen; therefore, one
of its leading clergymen, acting as
spokesman for the rest, defines for us
the worst enemy of New York—“or
any city.” Thus we get the quality of
logic that rules in our churches. It
would be laughable were it not pitiable
in its weakness. The church isn’t dead—it
can still call vile names ❦ How
nimbly it yet flings the theologic stink-pot!
The fires of the auto da fe are not
extinguished. They are only banked,
banked in the editorial office of <i>The
Christian Work and Evangelist</i>. “The
worst enemy of New York or any city!”
It is the old, old cry of “Away with
him!” ❦ It is the cry of entrenched
tyranny, that he who disagrees with
you in religious matters is the enemy
of the State. Socrates spoke disrespectfully
of the gods, and for this they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
brewed for him the hemlock. The crime
of Jesus was that he undermined the
State ❦ Savonarola, Bruno, Latimer,
Wyclif, enemies of society—all! ¶ The
editor of <i>The Christian Work and Evangelist</i>
thinks that the State and Religion
are one. And he is right. For just as
long as the State grants immunity from
taxation to church property, the divorce
is not complete. We haven’t yet caught
up with Thomas Jefferson. Well, you
know what the State in the past has
done to those who are considered its
enemies? Yes, and that is just what the
meek and lowly editor of <i>The Christian
Work and Evangelist</i> would do to you
if he had the power. ¶ Carefully read,
analyzed and digested, we find that the
sole excuses churches have for not paying
taxes are: First, the churches form
a police system which prevents certain
people from committing crime.
Second, the churches supply us a great
number of honest and unselfish citizens,
who otherwise would be rogues ❦ For<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
these two things they claim a cash reward
from the community. My answer
is that both propositions are assumptions,
quite gratuitous, but that, even
if they were true, it would not justify
the State in remitting their quota of
taxes. ¶ I have had a large and varied
experience with clergymen and church-members,
and that they are better
morally and stand higher intellectually
are propositions which they admit, but
which no one besides themselves puts
forward. The names of clergymen, Sunday-school
teachers and pious deacons
who go wrong would fill a five-foot
shelf of books. In fact, it is an axiom
that the bankers’ colony in every penitentiary
is made up mostly of church-members ❦
When the University of
Copenhagen says that church-members
are better citizens than non-church-members,
I may believe it. Until then,
the verdict must be, “Not Proved”—and
especially so, in view of the fact
that when Christianity was absolutely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
supreme the headsman worked overtime,
and crime, grime, blood, poverty, disease
and woe were the rule, not the
exception. The doctrine that some folks
are so much better than others that
they deserve eternal bliss is the most
selfish idea ever put forth by mortal
man. Folks who think they are better
than others, usually aren’t. That the
idea of endless joy for believers, and
endless hell for doubters, is not being
preached now so much as it was a few
years ago, is nothing to the credit of
church-members. ¶ All separations of
society into sacred and secular, good
and bad, saved and lost, learned and
illiterate, rich and poor, are illusions
which mark certain periods in the evolution
of society ❦ The offer of endless
life and the threat of endless hell
are frightful rudimentary errors of the
savage mind, born of fear and frenzy,
and then perpetuated as a police system
by a Divine Collection Agency. For not
only does a religion of fear keep people<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
“good,” but it also makes them pay
for being kept good. The offer of immunity
from the penalties of sin, through
belief in the blood of Jesus, is merely
the immunity that human sacrifice once
provided, slightly refined and modified.
The “belief” in a blood sacrifice has
taken the place of the sacrifice itself.
¶ The orthodox Christian Church still
teaches immunity from penalties on the
acceptance of its creed. From exemption
from the natural penalty of a misdeed
to exemption from taxation is but
a step. The man who can accept the
one takes kindly to the other. “Jesus
died and paid it all—yes, all the debt
I owe.” “Saved by the blood of the
Lamb.” That is, throw it off on some
one else. Who cares! Any way to go
scot-free! And this evasion of a penalty
for wrong committed is called “the glad
tidings of great joy.” To escape the
payment of taxes is a variation of the
same idea ❦ Many of these “saved”
people do not pay their debts until<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
compelled to. If they work for you they
loaf and visit on “company time.”
They cheat you in a hundred ways, and
often spend as much time trying to
evade the responsibility of shouldering
the burden as, rightly used, would have
carried the message to Garcia. ¶ The
entire Christian doctrine of rewards and
punishments, of a vicarious atonement,
and the substitution of a pure and holy
man for the culprit, is a vicious and
misleading philosophy ❦ That fear in
some instances has deterred men from
crime, there is no doubt. But the error
of religion as a police system lies in the
fact that it makes superstition perpetual.
Untruth that good may follow is not
a nice philosophy. ¶ It will be noted
that the learned editor of <i>The Christian
Work and Evangelist</i> pleads, as a reason
why churches should not pay taxes, the
assertion that three-fourths of all sermons
now preached deal with present-day
problems, and the effort is not
merely to save souls but to make better<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
citizens. This is doubtless true ❦ The
church is saving herself from dissolution
by becoming secularized. Gradually the
world is being educated into the belief
that one world at a time is enough.
Also, a vast number of men and women
see the fact that immunity and exemption
are not desirable, that nothing can
ever be given away, and that something
for nothing is very dear ❦ To make a
man exempt is to take from him just
so much manhood; and to make a
church exempt is to weaken the fabric
and place the institution on a mendicant
basis ❦ To accept salvation for
yourself, with the consciousness that
there is still one soul in hell, would turn
your paradise into purgatory, if your
soul were worth a damn. “One man is
no man,” said Aristotle four hundred
years before Christ. We are all parts
and particles of each other. ¶ This
matter of exemption from taxation of
certain edifices and certain men, transportation
at half-rates, and the ten-per-cent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
discount to clergymen and teachers,
all hinges on a lack of the Ethical
Monistic Concept ❦ It assumes that
certain work is sacred and other work
secular; that certain places are holy and
others profane. My esteemed colleague,
the editor of <i>The Christian Work and
Evangelist</i>, admits that this world is no
longer “but a desert drear, heaven is my
home.” He admits that we are here,
and that this is our home now, at least.
When he goes a step further and admits
that this is God’s world, not the Devil’s;
that every man is doing the best he can
with the light and power he possesses;
that all human service is sacred; that
there is no high nor low; that there are
no “saved” so long as men are in bonds
to fear, superstition and incompetence;
that a smokestack is as sacred as a
steeple—then he will agree with me
that churches should pay their just
quota of taxes. Good people no longer
ask immunity from payment of bills
because they are “good.” Businessmen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
are just as “good” as preachers. Business
today is founded on the thought of
reciprocity and mutuality ❦ We help
ourselves only as we help others. And
all transactions in life should be co-operative
and reciprocal. ¶ Granting
for argument’s sake that the Church
does do all the good claimed by my
Christian brother, still that is no reason
for its exemption. “So far as this Court
knows, all men who live in houses are
good men, making the world of men
better by their lives; but this is no
reason why their residences should be
exempt from taxation.” So said a wise
and learned judge in deciding the question
of taxation of parsonages in Illinois.
Here we get the growing concept of the
world of thinking men and women, the
concept of Ethical Monism. All is One,
and the sacred is that which serves. Pay
the price, and provided you pay the
price, the thing you buy is worth the
money. ¶ The churches will never do
the good they are capable of doing until<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
they throw off mendicancy. ¶ And the
beggar is a robber who has lost his
nerve, a bandit with a streak of yellow
in his ego. The churches must take their
stand, firmly and frankly, as human institutions,
asking no exemption, demanding
no immunity. Then they will
be free. For her own good the Church
must meet her responsibilities, and not
shift her burden of taxes upon the
people who do not believe her creed. If
you believe in a “peculiar” doctrine,
that is your affair, and you are the man
to pay for its support. To say that I must
pay for the support of your creed or else
be branded as a foe of society is bad logic,
worse ethics, and very indelicate, not to
say discourteous ❦ Only that is fair
and beautiful which neither threatens,
bribes, evades, demands nor supplicates.</p>

<p class="dropcap">The most important question
that confronts the future
is not New Thought,
the Juvenile Court, the
Tariff, the Single Tax, nor
Fletcherism. It is Free Motherhood.
The perpetuity of the race depends upon
Motherhood. I trust there will be no
argument on that ❦ The quality of
our race turns on the quality of the
parents; and especially does the quality
of the child turn on the peace, happiness
and well-being of the mother. You
can not make the mother a disgraced
and taunted thing and expect the
progeny to prosper. When you strike a
mother, you strike the race. There is no
hint in Nature that Motherhood is ever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
shameful or disgraceful. Only a social
and legal fiction ever makes it so. It is
vain to look to the Church for reform
in this direction. In fact, the Church is
the chief sinner. ¶ The necessity for
orphan asylums came in with the vows
of celibacy and chastity ❦ Wherever
these two things exist—celibacy and
chastity—orphan asylums flourish ❦
Less than five per cent of the children
in orphan asylums are orphans. The
rest are waifs and outcasts. If the State
did not make the mother a criminal; if
Society did not look upon her as disgraced;
and if the Church did not refer
to her as “ruined,” most of the mothers
of these “orphans” would cling to
them ❦ For every thousand orphans,
nine hundred mothers reach empty
arms out into the darkness. The desire
of the mother to protect and care for
her child is the most persistent instinct
that is implanted in the human heart.
If there is anything sacred in the world
it is mother-love. If there is anything<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
divine in the universe, it is the love of
the mother for her baby ❦ We give
pensions to the men who fought to save
the State. Why not give a pension to
every woman who goes down into the
valley of death and kisses the white lips
of pain? ❦ Isn’t the mother just as
necessary to the perpetuity of the State
as the soldier? I rather think so. The
necessity of the one is absolute, the
other is conjectural ❦ Every mother
should be recognized by the State “for
heroic services.” If she is not married,
her pension should be double that which
her married sister receives. We must
conserve mother-love, not dissipate it.
And let us remember this: We can not
successfully legislate against the biologic
imperative. To trample mother-love
ruthlessly into the mire of conventionality,
and tear the child from the
mother’s arms, and place it in an orphan
asylum, is the work of a false and hypocritical
“Christianity.” ¶ Now that the
whole world is trying to get back on a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
truthful basis as a move in the line of
self-preservation, is it not time that we
look this issue squarely in the face and
express ourselves concerning it? Before
this babe is born it runs the hazard of
murder from its conception ❦ That it
survives reveals its hold on eternal life.
When born, it is greeted with tears,
fears, secrecy, untruth, hypocrisy, and
its divine heritage of mother-love is
traded for a mess of institutional potash.
That most orphan asylums are now
managed by skilled and able people is
only a mitigation of the wrong. A substitute
is thus offered for mother-love—something
just as good ❦ But the
eternal fact remains: There is no substitute
for mother-love. God is that
jealous of it that He supplies nothing to
equal it. ¶ We can never have a noble
race of men until we have a noble race
of mothers. And in order to be a noble
woman, this woman must be economically
free ❦ Wonderful changes have
come to the world within a few years.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
For a woman not to wed, no longer
carries a penalty. The term “old maid”
has now no terrors. Spinsterhood is an
achievement, not a disgrace. ¶ The unmarried
woman between forty and fifty
is probably a self-supporting woman.
And this responsibility makes her the
mental superior of her married sister
who looks to a male man for food,
clothing and protection from the storm.
Yet because a woman has not seen fit
to marry is no reason for assuming that
the cosmic urge is dead. And just remember
this, that no woman ever lived
who couldn’t marry some man if she
wanted to. She will not marry because
she is not content to accept any old
thing. ¶ It is always a question of what
man. And as women more and more
are able to care for themselves—and
this is the one sure economic tendency
of the times—they will more and more
cease being willing to swear to honor,
love and obey one man for ninety-nine
years. Yet the mother instinct will not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
die on that account. The race will not
perish ❦ The independence of women
will make them better mothers. Their
children will be stronger in brain and
body, cleaner, abler, firmer in the ability
to discover and decide for the right.
But Free Motherhood must be respected.
¶ The word “illegitimate” is
now pretty nearly banished, since we
have discovered that God smiles upon
the freeborn child as upon none other.

scores of other intellectual kings that
might be named, have redeemed the
“small and select class” from the unmanicured
finger of shame ❦ We no
longer look askance upon the offspring;
as for the father we smile away his
“past” as a mere peccadillo, and he
becomes a deacon in the church—a
pillar of society. The mother, however,
Society still spits upon as one polluted.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
¶ This will not always be so. The very
fact that I am now writing on the subject,
and that several hundred thousand
gentle men and women—the very intellectual
pick of the world—will read
my words, argues progress. Others, too,
are writing. The world is changing—all
things are being made new ❦ The
crime of orthodoxy is its lack of faith.
It believes too little. What we want is
not a belief in one “immaculate conception,”
but a fixed and firm faith in
the fact that whenever and wherever a
mother holds in her arms a babe, hugging
it to her heart, crooning to it a
lullaby, there is God. ¶ When this time
comes the State will provide a pension
for every mother who cares for her babe.
¶ As an economic move, this will be
cheaper than maintaining orphan asylums.
The child will be loved, not institutionalized.
It will be a better citizen.
But best of all, we will wipe away
the tears of the mother. We will rejoice
with her that a man is born into the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
world ❦ We will extend gladness and
congratulation, not hypocritical sighs,
snarling sneers and sour faces. ¶ Froebel
spoke of the “little souls fresh from
God” ❦ And so, too, must we; and
when we do we will cease regarding the
mother, the vehicle of transport, as a
being to be shunned and maligned ❦
Rather, the miracle of Motherhood will
be reverenced; and this will be a great
moral uplift to all fathers as well as to
mothers. Thus will the whole race be purified,
benefited, strengthened and carried
forward toward the Divine Ultimate ❦</p>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-a.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="">
</div>

<p class="dropcap">A long and very carefully
written letter from an unknown
gentleman who
signs himself “Retired
Professor” has recently
reached me. ¶ The Great Obscure favor
me quite often with anonymous epistles,
but life being short and the wastebasket
wide, I seldom reply. Yet now an exception
must be made, and I answer “Retired
Professor” for the sole and simple
reason that he has “retired,” and in retiring
has made the world his debtor. Probably
no one act of this man’s entire life
has been so potent for good as this. He
has set all Professors without humor a
most precious precedent. ¶ In gratitude,
hoping that his example will bear fruit,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
I reply. ¶ Did space permit I should
be glad to print my correspondent’s letter
entire, but the gist of his scholarly
argument is that the Society of the
Philistines is endeavoring to make free-thought
universal and paganism popular.
He stoutly avers that the ancient
Philistines were the enemies of Jehovah,
that they worshiped strange gods, and
that they were the sworn foes of the
Chosen People. ¶ Now this is the sad
part: he proves his case. The gentleman
explains that he would not have seen
<i>The Philistine</i> Magazine had not his
daughter, “an unmarried lady of thirty-two,”
purchased several copies; but
from this on, with his permission, no
more numbers of this “infidelic infernal
machine” shall enter his house ❦ My
heart goes out to all unmarried ladies
of thirty-two. Especially so when they
have fathers who are irascible; only one
worse fate can befall a woman of thirty-two
than to have an irascible father,
and that is to have a lover who is irate.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
Still I doubt me not that the daughter
of “Retired Professor” will find a way
to read <i>The Philistine</i>, for booklets laugh
at locksmiths! ¶ Yet, ignorance prevails,
for is not “Retired Professor” living
proof? And so I will say: There lived
in the Far East about three thousand
years ago a tribe of people known as
Philistines ❦ It is a hotly mooted
question among the theologians whether
they were so called because they lived
in Philistia or whether Philistia took
its name on account of being peopled
by Philistines. I will not take sides on
this issue, but hedge closely and simply
stand firm on the fact that a tribe
called the Philistines existed ❦ Near
them lived the Hivites, the Moabites,
the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Jebusites,
the Perizzites, the Ammonites and
the Gothamites ❦ Now, among these
tribes none was so strong, none so intelligent,
none so handsome, none so
virtuous as the Philistines. And it came
to pass that the superior quality of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
moral fiber in the Philistines caused the
entire country to be known as Philistia;
it was the general name given to the
whole valley of the Jordan. And the
name endures even unto this day.
¶ Palestine means the land of the Philistines.
And it seems that among them
there was a rude sense of right and
wrong. For if a man owned a piece of
ground and planted a vine on it, and
then watered and tended the vine, the
grapes that grew on this vine were his,
and all of the people agreed to this, and
the man and his neighbors knew all
this without a Dispensation ❦ These
people planted vineyards, and had gardens,
and fields of wheat and barley.
They had barns with threshing-floors;
and they had carts, plows and other
implements. They builded houses and
owned their homes; and the men loved
their wives and their children; and the
women were the comrades of the men—all
taking part in the sports as well
as in the work, for they were a merry,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
happy people ❦ Now, about thirteen
centuries before the Christian Era, while
they were living in peace and prosperity,
there swooped down upon them
a horde of escaped slaves, called Israelites ❦
These slaves had broken away
from their masters in Egypt. The country
to which they traveled was only
about three hundred miles from Egypt;
but as their average speed was less than
a mile a week, it took them forty years
to make the journey. ¶ The man who
led these slaves in their flight was one
Moses, who in a righteous cause had
killed a man in Egypt and fled. After
many years of exile, during which time
he had been in Philistia and liked it, he
returned and led the exodus. When the
Israelites left, they took all the gold
and silver ornaments and utensils they
could “borrow,” and melted them up.
And they were not ashamed of this act,
for they have written it down in the
third chapter of a book called Exodus.
¶ The ancient Israelites never had any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
clear ideas as to the rights of property.
When they found grapes growing on a
vine, they helped themselves and swore
that the fruit was theirs by Divine right.
In order to impress this ignorant, barbaric
horde with the sense of authority,
Moses, who was diplomatic as well as
good, told the people that God directed
him and that Deity told him what to
do and say. Moses used to go up on a
mountain, clear above the clouds, beyond
where the mists hover, and when
he came down the people asked him
what he had been up there for, and he
told them he went up there to see God.
¶ In no other way could Moses control
this restless mob except by saying, God
says so and so. And the fact that their
leader was on such good terms with
Elohim or Yahveh inflated these people
so that they always spoke of themselves
as “the Chosen People of God.” In fact,
they took it all in and were so vain and
boastful that Moses was often ashamed
of them ❦ The Jebusites, the Hittites<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
and the Moabites never referred to the
Israelites as the Chosen People of God.
No one called them the Chosen People
of God—only they themselves. And I
wish to say right here that the individual
who does a great and magnificent
work is on close and friendly terms with
God. He is the Son of God, and it is necessary
that he should feel this kinship in
order to do his work. From Moses, the
called of God, on up to Socrates, who
listened to the Demon, to George Fox,
who harkened to the Voice, to the
prophets of our own time, all lie low in
the Lord’s hand and listen closely ere
they act. A man is strong only when he
feels that he is backed by a Power,
not his own, that makes for Righteousness.
So Moses was not guilty of falsehood;
but the people who took him
literally put him in a wrong light.
¶ When I think of those brave souls,
the Saviors of the World, who have
sought to lead men out of the captivity
of evil—feeling and knowing that they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
were the Sons of God—I stand uncovered ❦
But a mass of people—a
crowd, a mob—that claims to be a
“Chosen People” is a sight to make
angels weep. “You can not indict a class,”
said Macaulay; corporations have no
souls, and a horde that claims to be
inspired is only a howling, cowardly
Thing ❦ Great men are ever lonely and
live apart, but birds of a feather flock
together because they are afraid to flock
alone. They want warmth and protection—they
are afraid. A mob is the
quintessence of cowardice—a dirty,
mad, hydra-headed monster, that one
good valiant Saint George can thrust to
the heart. When a mob speaks I say,
Vox populi, vox devil! ¶ At the time
the Israelites tumbled pellmell upon the
Philistines, Moses had long been dead.
The mob was without a leader, and
quarrel was rife amid its broken ranks.
In a mad rush they stampeded the herds
of the Philistines, scattered their flocks,
destroyed their gardens, and as excuse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
they shouted, We are the Chosen People
of God! And one of their Poets sang
a song, which runs thus: “Moab is my
washpot; over Philistia will I cast my
shoe.” This only made the Philistines
laugh, and although the Israelites outnumbered
them, they went at it and
scattered them. Finally, after long years
of warfare, the fight was called a draw,
and the Jews settled down and following
the good example of the Philistines
made themselves homes. ¶ Of course,
as sane men and women, we of today
do not suppose that the great Universal
Intelligence that holds the world in
the hollow of His hand had much interest
in the fight. If this intelligence were
a Being, I can imagine Him looking
over the battlement of Heaven and
turning with a weary smile to Gabriel,
saying: “Let ’em fight—what boots
it! They will all be dead tomorrow,
anyway.” ¶ It is a noteworthy fact that
in the first chapter of the Gospel of
Saint Matthew the Inspired Writer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
traces the genealogy of Jesus direct to
the Philistines. In the sixth verse we
find “David begat Solomon of her who
had been the wife of Uriah.” Back of this
is Ruth the Moabitess, who was the
grandmother of David. There is no such
thing as tracing a pure Jewish lineage
back to the time of Moses ❦ The Jews
went a-courting as soon as they arrived
on the borders of Canaan; and the
heathen quite fancied the Israelitish
women from the first. ¶ In the Book of
Ruth, first chapter and fourth verse, I
see, “And they took them wives out of
the country of Moab.” The houses of
Capulet and Montague have ever intermarried—it
seems a quiet way Nature
has of playing a little joke. And after a
painstaking study of the matter I am
fully convinced that the many sterling
qualities in the Jew are derived from
his Philistine ancestry. No one doubts
that Solomon was the wisest man that
ever lived. His mother was a Philistine.
Now, no man is ever greater than his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
mother, and it is very plain that the
great wisdom of Solomon was derived
from this pagan woman whose body
and spirit nourished him, in whose loving
arms he was cradled, and whose
intellect first fired his aspiration. ¶ This
is all made plainer yet when we remember
that David had many sons by Jewish
women, and that all of these sons
were positively no good—and some of
them very, very bad ❦ The facts are
found in the Second Book of Samuel—a
book, by the way, which no respectable
girl should allow her mother to
read. But if any captious critic arises
and denies the Law of Heredity, for
argument’s sake I’ll waive this matter
of maternal transmission of excellence
and rest my case as to Solomon’s wisdom
on the fact that he married over
four hundred Philistine women ❦ And,
as stated by Sir Walter Besant in a
recent story, “a newly married woman
always tells her husband everything
she knows,” I feel safe in saying that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
Solomon’s transcendent wisdom was
derived from Philistinic sources. ¶ Only
one incident in the history of this people
do I wish to set straight before the world
at this writing—that is the story of
Goliath ❦ According to recently discovered
cuneiform inscriptions, it is
found that the giant lived long enough
to attend the funeral of David, so it is
hardly likely that David slew him.
That David threw pebbles at the warrior
is doubtless true, but the giant of
course paid no attention to the boys
that followed him—going along about
his business just as any other dignified
giant would have done ❦ But David
went home and told that he had killed
the man—and the Israelites wishing
to leave a proud record wrote the tale
down as history ❦ We have reason to
believe that this story was interpolated
into the Bible during the first of the
Third Century. In David’s case, summer
and autumn quite fulfilled the promise
of spring ❦ That eleventh chapter of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
Second Samuel, showing how he stole
Bathsheba and then killed Uriah, her
husband, reveals the quality of the man.
But it was left for his dying act to
crown a craven career ❦ With his last
lingering breath—with the rattle of
death in his throat—he gasped to his
son, referring to a man who had never
wronged him, “Let not his hoar head
go down to Sheol in peace!” With the
utterance of these frightful words his
soul passed out into the Unknown ❦
In all that David wrote, not a word
can I find that hints at his belief in a
future life—he simply never thought of
it—and dying as a dog dies, he gnashed
at Shimei, whose offense was that thirty-five
years before he had told David a
little wholesome truth ❦ Shimei was
a brave fellow and David dare not fight
him, so he made a truce with him and
swore an oath that he would never molest
him, but dying he charged Solomon
to search him out with a sword ❦ This
is recorded by the Inspired Writer in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
the ninth verse of the second chapter
of First Kings. With forty-one distinct
crimes to David’s charge, the killing of
nine hundred thousand men and two
hundred thousand women and children,
the houghing of thousands of horses,
all of which is set down in infallible
Holy Writ, his record is very bluggy.
In fact, his whole life’s pathway is
streaked with infamy ❦ David being a
literary man of acknowledged merit, I
have given him more attention than
I would a plain, every-day king. And I
now brand him as an all-round rogue.
I do this calmly, holding myself personally
responsible, and fully prepared
to plead justification and prove my case
should the heirs or next-of-kin consider
my language libelous. ¶ And while I
do not know anything about it for certain,
it is my opinion that at the Last
Great Day the folks who stayed around
home and pruned their vines and tended
their flocks and loved their wives and
babies will fare a deal better than those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
other men who made war on an innocent
people and tried to render them
homeless ❦ Of course, I may be wrong
about this, but I can not help having
an opinion. Altogether, my sympathies
are with the Philistines—who were so
strong in personality that they gave
their name to the Holy Land—Pelishton,
Pelesheth, Philistia, Palestina,
Palestine. ¶ Long years ago Professor
Jowett called attention to the fact that
the word Philistia literally meant Land
of Friendship; the term having the same
root as the Greek word <i>Philos</i>—Love.
Max Muller has said, “The dwellers
in the Valley of the Jordan, in the fifteenth
century before Christ, recognizing
the idea of Oneness or Fraternity,
gave a name that signified Love-Land
to their country: thus embodying the
modern thought of the Brotherhood of
Man.” ❦ In view of these things it was
rather a strange move—a man so
scholarly as Matthew Arnold applying
the word “Philistine” as a term of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
reproach toward those who did not
think as he did! I can see, though, that
he shaped his language to fit the ears of
his clientele. He sought to make clever
copy—and he did. The opinion being
abroad that the Philistines were the
enemies of Light—how very funny to
throw the word like a mud ball at any
and all who chanced to smile at his
theories! Having small wit of their own,
the scribbling rabble took it up. ¶ On
reading certain books by a Late Critic,
who now wears prison garb and is doing
the first honest work that ever his hands
found to do, I see that he is very fond
of calling people who are outside of his
particular cult, “Philistines.” But look
you! Brave Taurus at the bullfight is a
deal more worthy of respect than the
picadores who for a price harrow him
without ruth to his death ❦ And as
his virtue surpasses that of any in the
silken, belaced and perfumed throng,
who sit safe and with lily fingers applaud,
so do we accept your banderilla,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
recognizing from whence it comes, and
wear it jauntily as a badge of honor.
¶ As the Cross for eighteen hundred
years has been a sacred emblem, and the
gallows since John Brown glorious; and
as the word Quaker, flung in impudent
and impotent wrath, now stands for
gentleness, peace and truth, so has the
word Philistine become a synonym for
manly independence. ¶ In Literature he
is a Philistine who seeks to express his
personality in his own way ❦ A true
Philistine is one who brooks no let or
hindrance from the tipstaffs of letters,
who are only intent on crystallizing a
life and language that are as yet very
imperfect ❦ These men strive hard to
reduce all life to a geometrical theorem
and its manifestations to an algebraic
formula. But Fate is greater than a
college professor, and so far its mysteries,
having given the slip to all the
creeds, are still at large. My individual
hazard at truth is as legitimate as yours.
The self-appointed beadles of letters<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
demand that we shall neither smile nor
sleep while their Presiding Elders drone,
but we plead in the World’s Assize for
the privilege of doing both. So in Art
we ask for the widest, freest and fullest
liberty for Individuality—that’s all! ❦</p>

<p class="dropcap">In days agone, if things
tasted good we called
them “toothsome.” We
did not work the subject
out according to the Herbert
Spencer Law of Synthesis, but we
dimly felt that teeth and taste were
closely akin. And therein were we quite
correct ❦ The widow who declined to
marry the man, and on being discreetly
pressed for a reason, abruptly declared
with a Marie Corelli defiance that it
was because he did not have the Dental-Floss
Habit, was right in her instincts.
She would rid her of the reek
before she took it on as a life lease. For
it is just such little things that make
or mar, when we have sworn to love,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
honor and humor, and face the party
over the coffee-urn every morning for
ninety-nine years. The gentleman was
not personally pleasant, and although
he may have had a college degree, social
position and spondulex, yet a breath
that would stop a watch put him to the
bad, and rightly so. ¶ To such a one she
could never murmur soft and low the
word “Mizpah!” Nor could he salvo
his kismet magnum and get it back
again according to the Aristotelian laws
of action and reaction. For gentlemen
who are not toothsome are never socially
gladsome. If my years were not as
those of the pterodactyl, and I wanted
to win the love of a woman, I would
look well to my molars. ¶ Brain, brawn,
and the graceful two-step are as naught
when toothsomeness is actively absent.
Shakespeare had these two things in
mind when he referred to a “barber’s
breath,” and “the breath of an unfee’d
attorney,” which items do not come to
us as the breath of Spring. Abjure the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
weed and rice-paper, eliminate the elevated
spheroid, and look you to your
teeth, Cecil, to your teeth, I say. And
the rest follows. We all have our opinions
in matters of medicine, but no one
knocks on the dentist. Is love then a
matter of toothsomeness? ❦ I do not
speak by the card, for my knowledge
along this line is merely academic, yet
a woman I know says, “Yes.” ¶ But
seemingly, decayed teeth would give
Cupid a pain in his wee tummy small.
Decayed politics are bad; decayed literature
is worse; and to love a person
with decayed molars would be like loving
a mummy with tainted morals. The increase
in divorce, and the much marital
woe of which we hear, are doubtless
due to lack of toothsomeness ❦ The
parties grin and bear it as long as they
can—some declining to grin—and then
strike for freedom, fresh air and the
open road. ¶ Aside from the esthetics
of bad teeth, there is the esoterics, and
worse than that, is the hypersthenia<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
which leads to language non-ethical,
offensive, irrelevant and uncalled for.
¶ A very slight irritation in the teeth
throws the soul on the horn of the saddle.
To be sane and serene you have to
be sound and salient. We do business
on a mighty small spiritual bank-balance.
To carry no reserve is like firing
a boiler in which the gauges show no
water. In fact, it means a very great
danger of an explosion—and the grave
necessity of being sent to the hospital
and having the stub-end of your self-respect
removed. An aching tooth or a
tooth of which you are conscious draws
mightily on your mental reserve. Morphine,
or a dab of cotton soaked in
chloroform, will help you forget it, but
these things are drafts on the bank of
futurity and the loan must be met with
usurious interest. ¶ I once knew a playwright
who started in to write a great
historical drama; but he got a toothache,
and decided to make it a farce-comedy;
but all he produced was a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
fizzle ❦ Seldom does a man with the
toothache make good; and to have cavities
in your teeth and not know it is
worse than to have the toothache, since
pain is Nature’s beneficent warning ❦
So, to have decayed teeth and never
have a toothache would mean lack of
sensibility, which is lack of life. Such a
one hasn’t enough nerves to make him
irritable, much less to give him artistic
grouch ❦ And grouch is unused or misused
energy—and have I not said that
all energy is divine? You write your
poem, your essay, your play—just as
you paint your picture, carve your
statue, or give your oration—out of
your surplus, and never out of your
capital ❦ Should you begin to draw on
your capital you get nerv. pros. or fatty
degeneration of the cerebrum, and are
a candidate for Billy Muldoon’s. ¶ Is
oratory a matter of toothsomeness?
Most certainly, yes ❦ The greatest orator
that New York ever produced was
thrown from his artistic hobbyhorse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
once and forever, when his store-teeth,
in an impassioned moment, shot over
the footlights and fell with a sickening
thud into the orchestra. “Say, mister,
are these your teeth?” asked a man in
a front seat, as he solemnly arose and
handed up the grinders. And that broke
up the meeting ❦ I once saw a man,
singing the part of Tannhauser, do a
similar stunt. And we all declared that
he could go down to Venusburg and
stay there, for all of us—he ceased to
be interesting. ¶ Get this down as an
axiom: To speak well, or sing well, you
must have good teeth ❦ The teeth are
organs of speech—auxiliary organs at
least. When your voice whistles through
your teeth, and the tones come wheezy
and with a sort of sad surprise, there
are soon bubbles in your think-tank, and
you travel home on your rim. It is then
time to sing Tosti’s <i>Good-by</i>, and retire
from the stage, thereafter warbling only
to the gallery of your psychic self ❦</p>

<p class="dropcap">There are three serious
objections to my health
prescriptions ❦ First, I
make no charge for them.
Second, they are written
in plain English, without myth, miracle
or mystery, and can be understood even
by the mediocre mind. Third, you have
to fill the prescription yourself, and this
costs effort. Sickness is a selfish thing.
If you are well you are expected to work,
and give your time and talent to helping
other people. If you are sick you are
supposed to be immune from many unpleasant
tasks and duties. Mark Twain
said he was never really happy except
on two occasions. One was when he was
given that Oxford degree and wore a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
marvelous red cloak and a mortar-board
hat; and the other was when he had
the measles and expected to die. The
joy of holding the center of the stage
and having the whole family in tears,
just on his own account, was worth all
the pangs ❦ But, indeed, there were
no pangs. Mark was a humorist, and a
humorist is a man who has the sense of
values, and to have the sense of values
is wisdom. Mark was a great philosopher
as well as a humorist ❦ Not only
did he testify that pangs and pains are
the attributes of life, not death, and
that there is no pain in death, but he
also gave testimony that sickness is an
acute form of selfishness. The sick man
disarranges the entire scheme of house-keeping
wherever he is, unless he be in
a hospital. To have his meals served to
him in bed he regards as natural and
right ❦ For once he holds the center of
the stage—all dance attendance. Doctors
come, nurses run for this and that,
neighbors call and inquire. He is It.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
¶ The paranoiac is a person who craves
attention, and rather than go unnoticed,
commits crime. Just observe how most
sick people obtrude their maladies upon
their friends, and then tell me whether
sickness is not usually a form of paranoia!
Doctor Johnson said the sick man
is a rascal ❦ Not only is the remark
true, but Doctor Johnson might have
gone further and stated that a long
period of rascality is required to produce
most cases of sickness. Hate, prejudice,
revenge, jealousy, wrath, are all
disturbers of the circulation, and producers
of toxins. These toxins poison the
entire system, and continued, may produce
rheumatism, dyspepsia, Bright’s
disease, or various other pleasant things
for which we look to the doctor for relief.
¶ Most people go through life on a
short allowance of ozone, and a surfeit
of food. We eat too much and breathe
too little ❦ Life is combustion—the digestive
tract is a boiler. And as oxygen
is necessary to fire, so it is to life. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
value of exercise in the open air lies in
the fact that it is getting a goodly draft
of oxygen through your system, and
this forced draft is both eliminating
refuse and burning up slag ❦ These
things are all so trite and true that it
seems silly to write this for cultured
people, and yet cultured and educated
people are sick quite as much as the
other kind. In fact, more so, since necessity
is often removed and the person
has the privilege of going to bed in the
morning, getting up when he pleases,
eating a multiplicity of dishes that set
up an internecine war, giving the saw-buck
absent treatment, and forcing or
bribing other folks to wait on him. ¶ It
is a curious comment on our civilization
to find our great sanitariums and
health-resorts full of college graduates.
Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Dartmouth,
Vassar and Wellesley are all represented
constantly at Battle Creek, Dansville,
Mount Clemens, Hot Springs, Richfield
and Alma ❦ Imagine an LL. D. being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
given vicarious exercise by a healthy
colored man who can neither read nor
write; a Ph. D. looked after by a saucy
slip of a nurse, in becoming cap and
apron, fresh from the farm or paper-box
factory; an M. D. vigorously Muldooned
by a man who knows nothing
of medicine, but something of health!
¶ A great surgeon tells me that he has
never yet seen a case of appendicitis
where the patient has not been addicted
to the Beecham Habit. That is to say,
this disease is the result of medicine,
just as are many others. ¶ So here is
the prescription: Get the Health Habit—by
throwing physic to the dogs, because
it will not hurt the dogs, since
they know better than to swallow it;
drink plenty of pure water; eat what
you like, but do not overeat; have a
regular daily occupation; breathe much
and deeply in the open air; have a
veranda bedroom, open if possible on
two sides, or at least sleep in a room
with windows run up wide, even if the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
water-pitcher freezes; think well of
everybody, especially doctors, for good
doctors everywhere are practising a
Science of Prevention, and will corroborate
these suggestions ❦ They are
doing the best they can, considering
the ignorance, superstition and inertia
which they have to combat—often in
their own minds, and those of others.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Here is a story told me
the other day by a drummer
traveling for the Solvay
Process Company.
We were on the New
York Central, riding from Syracuse to
Albany ❦ The incident has a fromage
flavor that makes it look like lallapaloosala
persiflage. However, it may be
true, for no one is in such danger of
the Ananias Club as he who has the
courage to give the plain, unvarnished
facts ❦ I am unable to recall his exact
words, and so I use my own language.
¶ So say we, tell we the tale: My friend,
the drummer, took the Owl, a midnight
train from Chicago to Des Moines ❦
The section just across from his berth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
was occupied by a Vision in Gray. ¶ The
chromatic ensemble was that known at
Wanamaker’s as “elephant’s breath.”
From the tip of her toe to the proudly
defiant Henry of Navarre ostrich-plume,
she was an ecstacy in silvery gray. The
Chiaroscuro was as lissome, billowy,
willowy, pearly, evasive and impressionistic
as the fog that hangs low on
the October corn, when the rising sun
is a great, round, red ball on the rim
of the dreamy and effete East ❦ From
Land’s End to John O’Groat’s the symphony
was satisfying and complete.
Her hat was a milliner’s creation; her
dress an architect’s dream, devised by
Kirk Cutter in an artistic seizure; her
hair was done up as provided by the
Interstate Commerce Commission. Yet
the woman was modest, refined, lady-like.
Her high-sign only referred to the
duds and haberdashery ❦ She was
neither fly nor flip—merely bouffant,
that’s all. She was as tall as the Solvay
Process man, for he had observed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
it, being from Syracuse. ¶ The Pullman-car
conductor came through and
took up the tickets. The Vision in Gray
had the whole section—she said so—she
needed the upper berth for her
clothes, and cautioned the porter that
the space was hers. “Yassum! Comin’
up!” said George in reassuring tones
that cost a quarter. He had no tissue
envelope big enough for the hat, so it
was covered with two copies of the
Chicago <i>News</i>. ¶ The train started. Soon
the curtains were drawn and the lights
turned low; nothing was heard save the
rumble and roar of the onward rush of
the train, and the snores of an obese
attorney, traveling for pleasure. Morning
came. It often does. It came dim and
foggy. Lights blinked, six o’clock whistles
blew, calling workmen from their
beds to toil ❦ The man from Syracuse
was awakened by words of tumult and
sounds of entreaty. The porter was
swearing an alibi in a tearful Scipio
Africanus voice: “Ah nevah saw dem<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
close, Missus! Ah hope to die—Fo’
Gawd, I hope to die! I’se a Baptis’ an’
nevah done nothin’ bad in my life!”
And from out the berth filled by the
Vision came subdued feminine threats,
which died away in half-sobs of anguish
that shook the soul of the Solvay Process
party, strong man though he was.
¶ The Pullman Conductor came. The
train conductor was summoned ❦ The
flagman who guards the rear end forgot
his duties, as he stood in the aisle with
his red flag, and attached to it two cartridges
and a red light, ready to fire on
a second’s notice of danger. The train
conductor was trying to make a list of
the things lost ❦ The upper berth was
absolutely empty. The hat was gone;
the dress, a tailor-made fabric, which the
unseen said between sobs was worth
two hundred dollars, was swallowed by
oblivion. All the fluffy ruffles had disappeared.
“Haven’t you a kimono?”
asked the Pullman Conductor, not so
much for information as to reveal his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
knowledge of technique. ¶ “I did have,
but that has gone too,” was the anguish-laden
response ❦ Alas! All she had was
the suit of pajamas that she wore which
clung close in this time of need. Even
the gray chamois-shoes were gone. Two
women had left the train at four o’clock
in the morning at the Junction, but
they carried nothing save hand-bags.
“They could have put my clothes on
over theirs,” murmured the lady from
out the dismal depths of Lower Number
Nine ❦ The train-hands retired to
the smoking-room to consult. It was
no joke to them—they were all under
suspicion. ¶ Suddenly, the man from
Syracuse had an Idea. He had with
him an extra pair of trousers, and of
course the regular business-suit he wore.
Hastily he groped beneath his berth
for his suitcase. With trembling hands
he pulled forth the pants. He reached
over and pushed them into the berth,
saying: “Here, Miss, I am an Elk ❦
Don’t be afraid, I’m an Elk, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
first prong of my creed is to do good ❦
I am a respectable married man from
Syracuse. I’ll help you out of this fix—put
on these.” And then, his generosity
increasing as the Good Samaritan
instincts in his cosmos began to find
expression, he handed over his coat and
vest. “Then here is my raincoat, which
will come to your feet!” “Oh, thanks,
kind sir,” she said; “but I can not take
your clothes—for what will you do?”
The voice was flute-like, and modulated
like an aeolian. “Oh, I don’t need any
clothes,” said the liar from Onondaga
County; “besides, I have another suit.”
¶ “But my hat! my hat!” moaned the
lady. “Take this,” said the disciple of
Chancellor Day. “Take this. I have
my traveling-cap,” and he pushed the
hat into the unseen depths ❦ It was a
big, light-colored Roycroft Stetson.
“Do your hair up on top of your head,
and pull the hat well down—it will be
all right—don’t cry!” ¶ “But I have
no shoes!” “Wear mine—I have a pair<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
of slippers.” ❦ And he pushed his shoes
through the curtain, and looked the
other way. Only the onward roar of the
train was heard as the conductors came
back. “You are sure you had the clothes
on when you boarded the train?” asked
one conductor in a voice ill-concealing
his resentment. “Never mind—I’ll get
along—go away—I will make my claim
on the road direct. Go away, please!”
They were glad enough to get away.
¶ As the gloaming began to gloam, the
porter turned up the lights. Now and
then the electric bell buzzed. The obese
party was calling for his shoes. A man
had lost an umbrella. He got it. A lady
in an upper berth wanted a stepladder.
The porter was working like mad making
up berths so as to brush his passengers
and receive the offertory before
they got to Des Moines. A party wearing
a long raincoat and a big, light-colored
Roycroft Stetson emerged cautiously
from a berth, and hurried toward the
ladies’ dressing-room ❦ “Hi, Kuhnel,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
t’other end of the kyar, if you don’
min’, please,” called the porter ❦ The
berths were all made up. The porter
had brushed everybody except the party
wearing the big Stetson, drawn low,
who occupied Number Nine. The porter
had now concluded that the unpleasantness
of the early morning was the
result of a hoodoo—the failure to carry
his rabbit’s foot. It was all a bad dream!
“Brush!” he said, with a flourish, approaching
the party in the long raincoat.
The Stetson shook, and two sad, gray
eyes looked straight at the colored
brother ❦ He fled in dismay. George
was out a quarter that he had counted
on. The drummer from Syracuse, wearing
his ulster buttoned to the chin,
helped the soft-hatted party out of the
car, through the station into the Hotel
Savery bus. “I’ll send your clothes back
as soon as I can buy more,” said the
lady in her low, musical voice ❦
“Oh, don’t bother!” said Dionysius of
Syracuse, blushing brick-dust. ¶ The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
drummer forgot to give her his address,
and to take hers. He felt sort of guilty,
being a respectable married man, and
from Syracuse, as before stated. He did
not go to the Hotel Savery, as usual.
¶ He bought a pair of shoes, a smart
Stein-Bloch Company suit, saw his trade,
and left for Omaha on the Two-ten.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Did it ever strike you that
it is a most absurd and
semi-barbaric thing to set
one day apart as holy? If
you are a writer and a
beautiful thought comes to you, you
never hesitate to write it down because
it is Sunday ❦ If you are a painter, and
the picture appears before you, vivid
and clear, you make haste to materialize
it before the vision fades. If you are a
musician, you sing a song or play it on
the piano, that it may be etched upon
your memory—and for the joy of it.
¶ But if you are a cabinetmaker you
may make a design, but you will have
to halt before you make the table, if
the day happens to be the “Lord’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
Day”; and if you are a blacksmith,
you will not dare to lift a hammer for
fear of conscience or the police. All of
which is an admission that we regard
manual labor as a sort of necessary evil,
which must be done only at certain times
and places. ¶ The orthodox reason for
abstinence from all manual labor on
Sunday is that “God made the heavens
and the earth in six days and rested the
seventh day”; therefore, man, created
in the image of his Maker, should hold
this day sacred. How it can be possible
for a supreme, omnipotent and all-powerful
being, without “body, parts
or passions,” to become wearied through
physical exertion, is a question that is
yet unanswered. ¶ The idea of serving
God on Sunday and then forgetting
Him all the rest of the week is a fallacy.
Sunday with its immunity from work
was devised for slaves who got out of
all the work they could during the
week. No man can violate the Sabbath;
he can, however, violate his own nature,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
and this he is more apt to do through
enforced idleness than through either
work or play. Only running water is
pure; stagnant nature of any sort is
dangerous, and a breeding-place for
disease. ¶ Change of occupation is
necessary to mental and physical health.
As it is, most people get too much of
one kind of work. All the week they
are chained to one task, a repugnant
task because the dose is too big. They
have to do this particular job or starve.
This is slavery, quite as much as when
man was bought and sold as a chattel.
¶ Will there not come a time when all
men and women will work because it is
a blessed gift—a privilege? Then, if all
worked, wasteful consuming as a business
would cease ❦ As it is, there are
many people who do not work at all,
and these pride themselves upon it and
uphold the Sunday laws. If the idler
would work, no one would be over-worked.
If this time ever comes, shall
we not cease to regard it as wicked to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
work at certain times, just as much as
we should count it absurd to pass a law
making it illegal for us to be happy on
Wednesday? Isn’t good work an effort
to produce a useful, necessary or beautiful
thing? If so, good work is a prayer,
prompted by a loving heart—a prayer
to benefit and bless. If prayer is not a
desire, backed up by a right human
effort to bring about its efficacy, then
what is it? ¶ Work is a service performed
for ourselves and others. If I love you I
will surely work for you—in this way
I reveal my love. And to manifest my
love in this manner is a joy and a gratification
to me. Thus, work is for the
worker alone, and labor is its own reward.
These things being so, if it is wrong
to work on Sunday, then it is wrong to
love on Sunday; every smile is a sin,
every caress is a curse, and all tenderness
a crime. ¶ Must there not come a
time when we shall cease to differentiate
and quit calling some work secular and
some sacred? Isn’t it as necessary for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
me to hoe corn and feed my loved ones
(and also the priest) as for the priest to
preach and pray? ¶ Would any priest
ever preach and pray if somebody did
not hoe? If life is from God, then all
useful effort is divine; and to work is
the highest form of religion ❦ If God
made us, surely He is pleased to see that
His work is a success. If we are miserable,
willing to liberate life with a bare
bodkin, we certainly do not compliment
our Maker in thus proclaiming His work
a failure. But if our lives are full of gladness
and we are grateful for feeling that
we are one with Deity—helping God
do His work—then, and only then, do
we truly serve Him. ¶ Isn’t it strange
that men should have made laws declaring
that it is wicked for us to work?</p>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="">
</div>

<p class="dropcap">The first requisite in life
is that we shall be able to
earn a living. For our own
good we must be able to
produce as much or more
than we consume, and to make two
grins grow where there was only a
grouch before. And we can help ourselves
only by helping others. A transaction
where only one side makes money
is immoral. ¶ Reciprocity, Co-operation,
Mutuality, are the three big words. To
be of genuine advantage, all human
effort must be reciprocal. The worker
who works merely with his own benefit
in mind doesn’t get much benefit ❦
Personal good comes incidentally, and
to go after a gain direct is to have it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
elude you. The very effort you put forth
to secure the thing sets in motion an
opposition that makes it slip away beyond
your reach. The man who seizes
culture by the cosmic scruff will never
secure her tender confidences. ¶ If you
want to study the birds you do not go
in wild search for them; you simply
seat yourself on a log in the woods and,
lo! soon the branches are vibrant with
song. To clutch for love and demand it
makes you both unlovely and unlovable.
If you would have friends, be one.
¶ This great spiritual law which provides
that we lose the thing for which
we selfishly strive has seemingly been
overlooked in our universities and institutions
that foster the so-called Higher
Culture. Fond parents send their sons
to college for but one reason—not to
earn a living, not to render the world a
service, not to perform some necessary
task—they send them to college in
order to absorb and appropriate a certain
imaginary good. The idea of reciprocity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
in a college is a barren ideality. The
“work” is non-productive, futile, fictive,
fallacious and imaginary. In all
Nature there is no analogy to this thing
of making an animal as big as his father
exempt from securing his own living ❦
The birds in the nest are fed, and the
young are suckled; but a weaning-time
that does not take place until long after
adolescence is fraught with danger. The
plan is medieval and dates to a time
when conspicuous waste and conspicuous
leisure were the badge of respectability.
The college is really a mendicant
institution: its teachers and students
belong to the parasitic class. ¶ The fact
that a thing has to be endowed proves
there is something wrong with it. It is
not self-sufficient and in itself supplies
no excuse for being. It requires an explanation.
No explanation ever explains
the necessity of making one. ¶ Our system
of teaching will never approximate
the perfect until we devise an Industrial
College where the students will produce<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
as well as consume. The school then
will not be an imitation of life—it will
be life ❦ The fact that many college
graduates are highly successful men
does not answer the argument—that
very many college graduates are wholly
incompetent is the thing that forms the
damning count. The man who gets his
education out of his work, at his work,
is the type that has always ruled and
yet rules the world. We are safe only as
we move with Nature; and any system
of teaching that seeks to improve on
Nature is founded on fallacy. ¶ There
is only one valid reason for sending a
boy to college, and that is, so he can
discover for himself that there is nothing
in it. A college degree, as matters now
stand, is like a certificate of character—useful
only to those who need it. However,
there must surely come a time
when degrees will be given only to those
who can earn a living—and this degree
will be signed by the young man’s employer.
¶ All this for the simple reason<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
that no man is a safe person whose time
is not employed in some useful daily
occupation where others as well as himself
are the gainers. Time and energy
not used, or misused, form a dangerous
dynamite; while time and human effort
fused with reciprocity produce radium.
Can you earn a living? Also, do you? ❦</p>

<p class="dropcap">A short time ago I spent
a week in Saint Louis ❦
During that week there
were three deaths of children
from tetanus (lock-jaw),
all the direct result of vaccination.
The Board of Health had been very busy,
and all children that could not show a
scar were vaccinated, this without consent
of the parents or of the child. For
each vaccination the city paid the kind
doctors delegated to do the work, the
sum of fifty cents. That is to say, these
physicians operated on healthy children,
introducing a poison into their systems,
thus giving them a disease, in order to
prevent them from having one—all
for half a dollar per child ❦ The three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
children that died netted the doctors a
dollar and a half. ¶ As before stated,
these children died, and scores of others
were made seriously ill. How many were
poisoned for life no one knows. Children
know all that the parents know,
and the report that vaccination had
killed several struck panic to the hearts
of those not yet vaccinated ❦ Many
children refused to go to school for fear
of the doctors. And such was the alarm
through non-attendance that the School
Board called a meeting and passed a
resolution asking the Board of Health
to desist from these fifty-cent operations
until the question of the quality of
the virus used could be passed upon.
¶ Now, there is no such thing as a “pure
virus.” Vaccine virus is a poison in itself.
And vaccination, if it “takes,” always
reduces the resiliency or resisting-power
of the patient, laying him open to any
germ that may be flying around that
way. ¶ The President of the Board of
Health took refuge behind the law,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
which required him to vaccinate the
school-children ❦ But personally he
said he thought the whole system was
founded on a superstition, and on a very
barren assumption. Said the physician:
“Many people who are vaccinated never
have smallpox. A few who are vaccinated
have smallpox. To assume that
those who are vaccinated would have
smallpox if they were not vaccinated
is childish reasoning, fit only for those
who are willing to accept a tainted
plea, because they are already convinced ❦
I must admit that the logic
of vaccination is no reason at all, and
could only appeal to prejudiced, ignorant
and unthinking people ❦ I wish
we were rid of the whole thing, but I
am not strong enough to stem the tide.
Doctors get paid for vaccination, the
books and colleges uphold it, and this
thing will go on until the people revolt,
which I hope they will do soon.” ¶ Here
we get the expression of an honest man—an
Allopath physician—caught in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
the toils of Custom ❦ Physicians are
instructed from books, in colleges, and
by professors who were taught from
books in colleges. This is not knowledge:
it is the memorizing of things
evolved many years ago by men who
knew much less than we do ❦ Very few
physicians know how to live. Everywhere
you find doctors who are soaked
in tobacco, booze and dope, breathing
foul air, thinking vile thoughts, resorting
to stimulants as a pick-me-up ❦
These are the men that uphold vaccination—these
are the men who assaulted
the school-children of Saint Louis, and
forced a poison into their healthy bodies
for fifty cents a body. Oh, the shame
of it! ¶ Immunity from disease comes
from fresh air, pure water, clean surroundings,
an active, useful life, and
kind thoughts ❦ The fear wrought in
a school by one of these bewhiskered
rogues, with his outfit of scalpels, scarifiers
and poison, is a cause of disease
in itself. The plan of vaccinating the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
mind with the virus of fear is in itself
a crime, and a most common cause of
disease. ¶ Doctor J. H. Tilden says that
the fear of disease spread abroad by
doctors is the cause of more deaths than
the White Plague ❦ People who live
rightly are well. It is right living and
sanitary surroundings that have banished
smallpox. Just good sanitation
has banished the “plague,” that mysterious
disease which swept Europe again
and again, and which killed one-third
of the inhabitants of London in Sixteen
Hundred Sixty-five ❦ I believe, with
Tilden, that the so-called Science of
Medicine has been a positive curse to
mankind, just as Christianity has, with
its bogus “Plan of Salvation.” ¶ Salvation
lies in work, play, study, right
living and right thinking, and not in
belief in the death of a good man in
Asia two thousand years ago. As a cure
for our physical pains we have looked
to a poison doctor, instead of studying
the case ourselves and ascertaining<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
why we suffered ❦ We must learn to
rely on ourselves, and not put either
our souls or our bodies in jeopardy
by turning them over to a “cure of
souls” with collar buttoned behind, or
to a hirsute gent who will give you
a disease for fifty cents, in the interest
of happiness, health and long life.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Many good women do not
care to vote, and they
give this as a reason why
equal suffrage should not
be allowed. The logic is
so faulty that it really serves as a reason
for the antis. A woman’s reason is
often the work of the genus male ❦ An
Englishman, recently arrived in New
York City, stopped at the Hotel Majestic.
After two days he notified the
proprietor that no more circulars which
came by mail should be sent to his
room. “Because,” said this son of ’Appy
Halbion, “I find it a task too great for
my strength to acknowledge receipt of
all of them, and have, therefore, decided
not to accept any more.” When asked,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
“What’s the matter with the wastebasket?”
he carefully examined that
useful article and said that, so far as he
could see, it was all right. “Give decisions,
but never reasons,” said the wise
old judge to the young judge ❦ “Your
decisions will usually be right, but your
reasons seldom.” Women who do not
want to vote should not stand in the
way of women who do. Voting is not
compulsory, upon either male or female ❦
Voting is a privilege. Voting is
simply the expression of your political
preferences. Every one should have preferences,
because they have opinions. We
grow through the expression of opinions
and through making decisions. Voting
is deciding between this candidate and
that, this policy or the other ❦ Hence,
it tends to definite, logical thinking.
One of the old arguments made against
Woman Suffrage was that, if women
were allowed to vote, they would be
compelled to do jury duty, because the
jurors are selected from the poll-list.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
This is one of the piffling reasons—“woman’s
reasons.” Everything in Nature
tends to adjust itself ❦ It is quite
natural for women to express themselves.
In fact, they always have, if
history and experience are worth anything.
But why they should be forbidden
this particular form of political expression,
only the male knows, and, in fact,
to use a Hibernicism, he doesn’t. ¶ In
the State of Washington, a woman can
accept the subpoena to do jury duty,
or she can decline it. The law, which is
only crystallized custom, defers to her
wishes ❦ If she simply tells the deputy
sheriff, “Nothing doing!” he marks
her name off the list. She is not obliged
to give any reason why she does not
wish to serve as a juror, any more than
she is obliged to give a reason why she
does not vote ❦ This seems eminently
consistent, right, proper, and well within
human rights. Suffrage simply is a
recognition by the State that woman
is a human being. Where women have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
served on juries, they have been found
to be eminently attentive and anxious to
view the question involved from every
standpoint, and to reach a sane and
just conclusion. ¶ Judge W. W. Black,
of Everett, Washington, has recently
said from the bench: “My experience
with the ladies in the jury-box has
been that the trial of the case has been
expedited, and the whole proceedings
marked with a dignity and decency
which did not before exist ❦ And the
verdicts, for the most part, were well
within the legal limits, eminently just
and proper ❦ I do not find that woman’s
mental ability to grasp a point
in law is inferior to that of man’s.”</p>

<p class="dropcap">Be patient with the boys.
You are dealing with soul-stuff.
Destiny awaits just
around the corner. Boys
evolve into men, and men
sometimes change the boundary-lines
of States. They make political parties;
they crown kings, and they put them
to flight. They bring contention or they
make peace. They may build or they
may destroy. But boys misused, abused,
betrayed, never forget and seldom forgive.
It is a terrible thing to plant the
germs of suspicion and hate in the mind
of a child ❦ Tyranny visited on a boy
may implant in his heart dragons’ teeth
that spring up and grow into armed
men. The breath of hate consumes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
and its voice affrights. Gluttony and
greed sometimes leave the boy out of
the equation ❦ Gluttony and greed
fatten and forsake. They invite and they
alienate. They welcome and they repel.
Grasping greed sometimes forgets. It
is the thing that brings mental and
moral diseases and disorders of the
state that can not be cured. ¶ Boys
can not be deceived. Naturally, they are
truthful. They are elemental. They do
not know how they judge or why. The
words of your lips count for little. They
know the things that are hidden in your
heart. To arrest boys and fasten upon
them the strong hand of the law is a
tragic thing. A slight, a boy will forgive;
but injustice, never. Boys can be led:
they can’t be driven. They respond to
love, but tyranny may set their hearts
aflame. My heart goes out to the boys.
¶ In Kansas City I know one newsboy
who supports a widowed mother and
several brothers and sisters younger
than he. I know two newsboys, brothers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
whose scanty savings are sending an
elder sister to the State Normal School,
that she may be fitted to become a
teacher. ¶ Thomas A. Edison was a
newsboy. He sold papers on the streets
of Detroit, and on the Grand Trunk
trains. While selling papers on the rail-road
platform at Mount Clemens, he
saw a little youngster toddle out on the
track, in front of an approaching train.
At the risk of his own life, Tom Edison,
the newsboy, grabbed the youngster,
sprang upon the footboard of the engine
and saved the life of the baby. For this
deed the station-agent rewarded Edison
by teaching him the telegraph-key. We
know the rest. ¶ Paginini was a street
musician when a boy, playing his violin
and holding up his hat for pennies ❦
Martin Luther was an outcast and a
street singer when a youngster ❦ Occasionally
the proud and the strong
would push him out of the way into
the gutter. Such treatment made scars
on his soul that time did not efface. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
is a terrible thing to kill animation and
joy and enthusiasm in the heart of a
child. Boys should be encouraged, and
not ground down to a starvation-point
in all of their worthy and useful little
industries. ¶ Give the boys a chance to
grow, to enjoy, to work, to save their
pennies and become men ❦ I used to
know a newsboy who cried his wares
up and down in front of the hotel where
I stopped. The years went by, as the
years do. Twenty-five years passed, and
I stood in a court of appeal to present
a motion which was of vital importance
to me. The judge who sat on the bench
looked to me strangely familiar. All at
once it came over me with a flash that
this judge was once the newsboy from
whom I had bought newspapers in front
of the hotel. He now held for me the
ability to wither or to bless, to destroy
or to protect. Fortunately, for me, his
heart and brain were right. ¶ Be patient
with the boys. Bad boys are good boys
who misdirect their energies. The hope<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
of the race lies with the boys. In a year
or two we will be going to hear them
preach from pulpits; we may go to them
to borrow money; they may operate on
us for appendicitis—aye, they may
preach our funeral sermons. Nobody
can prophesy the success to which a boy
will attain. Difficulty, trial, hardship,
work—these are the things that evolve
boys into men. Boys can be led. They
can not be driven. ¶ Be patient with
the boys ❦ You are dealing with soul-stuff.
Destiny awaits around the corner.</p>

secrets. In his breast are
stored away all the elements that go to
make up the round world. Beneath his
depths lie buried the sunken kingdoms
of fable and legend, whose monarchs
have long been lost in oblivion ❦ He
appropriates and makes his own all that
is—dissolving the rocks that seek to
stop his passage—forming, transforming,
rearranging, never ceasing, tireless.
Tireless ever, for he gets his rest in
motion. With acute ear he listens along
every coast and lies in wait for the
spirit of the offshore wind ❦ All rivers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
run to meet him, carrying tidings from
afar, and ever the phosphorescent dust
from other spheres glimmers on his surface.
¶ It is not to be wondered that
men have worshiped the ocean, for in
his depths they have seen mirrored the
image of Eternity—of Infinity ❦ Here
they have seen the symbol of God’s
great plan of oneness with His creatures,
for the sea is the union of all
infinite particles, and it takes the whole
to make the one. ¶ Men have fallen on
their faces to worship the sea. Women
have thrown him their children to appease
his wrath. Savagely yet tenderly
has he received the priceless treasure
and hidden it away where none could
recall ❦ He has heard the dying groans
of untold thousands, and drowned their
cries for help with his own ceaseless
roar; but still his ear has not failed to
catch the whispers of confession that
have come from souls about to appear
before their Maker. And yet how beautiful
and kind is he in his apparent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
relentless cruelty, for he keeps only the
transient part, and gently separates the
immortal and wafts the spirit back to
God who gave it. ¶ And what does the
sea do with all these secrets, mysteries
and treasures? Go shrive thyself, and
with soul all in tune to the harmonies
of the Universe listen to the waves and
they shall tell thee the secrets of life!</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
